      " here https transgendersg . com response to dr quentin van meters webinar on transgenderism is the debunking of dr quentin s trans webinar that i wrote for transgendersg , which the article mentioned . below are extracts from the review i wrote for my friends after taking one for the team dr quentin would make a point , cite impressive peer reviewed papers in tiny text , and then when i looked them up i found that they said the direct opposite of what he did . he does this multiple times . he also does this thing where he expounds in passionate length on an anti trans point , mumbles as he acknowledges criticism that nullifies all he just said , and then while i m impressed and waiting in anticipation for how he would address that , he moves on to the next slide and i am sad . he said that if an archaeologist were to dig up a trans person s skeleton years from now , they would identify their sex based on the morphology of their bones . he says this proves that only biological sex is real . he said that the terms transmale and transfemale are liberal propaganda and instead the scientifically accurate terms are transmasculine and transfeminine . i was very confused . my favourite argument was when he objected to the term sex assigned at birth by explaining in great , painstaking detail the nature of gender reveal parties at one point he was talking a lot about the culinary process of baking a gender reveal cake for such parties , which delighted me because i enjoy cake , eventually coming to his triumphant point that if sex was really only assigned at birth , gender reveal parties would not be possible , because they are organised before birth . his theory which he returned to repeatedly on how people become trans is this sad kids want an escape from their suffering maybe they were very poor , or abused , or their parents died they become enchanted by the carousel of social media , which he says kids are into these days . he talked about carousels for about minutes . he explained what they are , with the lights and music , and how they go round and round and round . then , someone on the carousel presents them with cotton candy , which in this extended metaphor is the enticing suggestion that changing sex is the solution to all their problems . this excites them because it s what all the celebrities are doing these days . so they change their sex , and sometimes it does make them happy , but at other times it doesn t , and the carousel crashes and they die . he was inexplicably convinced that that sex reassignment surgery destroys a person s ability to experience orgasm or sexual intimacy , the former of which i believe has not been a significant risk since the s or earlier . so he argued against children transitioning because at that age they cannot possibly understand the ramifications of what it would mean to never be able to orgasm in their life , and never be able to experience sexual intimacy or have a family of their own . he sounded genuinely sad . q a someone asked if there are ways to resolve gender dysphoria in young people other than transition . he started talking about how he knows a lot of kids because he s a pediatrician , and it s nice to watch them grow up , and then they go to college , and then sometimes they visit and he can chat to them about what their majors are and what s happening in their lives , or with their families , and and what they plan to do in future , and he loves to see the kind of people they re growing up to be . . . . and then , in this zoom room full of ultra conservative christians , his non answer to that question concluded with . . . and then someone might realise i m not a transgendered female , i m a gay adult man ! and that is what i intend to be and i will be happy as being , but for god s sake , i almost had my anatomy cut off and all of my tissue that would respond to erotic stimuli taken from me , because i had same sex attraction and i found that transgender is more acceptable by society , you know , there s a bit of celebrity to it now , and i almost ruined my life ! \n",
      "conservatism largely have no real data or facts to back up their policies . its all lies and propaganda made to make the new stuff scary so lets stick with the old stuff . lgbt literally does nothing doesnt affect anyone that isnt in the community . pride parades ? just ignore them . drag shows ? just dont go . gay marriage ? unless youre having one , why do you care ? \n",
