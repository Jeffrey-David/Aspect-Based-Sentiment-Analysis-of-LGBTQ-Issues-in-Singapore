"the article makes it pretty clear that while 377a doesn t actually get used directly , it serves as an anchor for legal discrimination in other forms .","it is however an obstacle that very likely needs to be cleared before the possibility of more inclusive legislations can be created . the article makes it pretty clear that while 377a doesn t actually get used directly , it serves as an anchor for legal discrimination in other forms . clearing this obstacle will open up the path for further progress . people do and should care about 377a for that reason . the real fight will indeed be the battle against morals that are antithesis to each other , but that doesn t mean people don t or should not care about 377a which is the obstacle directly in front of us now .

"furthermore , support for 377a isn t exactly anti lgbt .","your nazi analogy is flawed . firstly , there is a fundamental difference between catholics and protestants . the very reason why protestants exists is because they reject fundamental beliefs of the catholic church , protested against them hence the name and started their own church . to put it plaintly , there s no such thing as a nazi who believes jews are equal . such a person belongs to a completely different category . next , you re linking being gassed by nazis with acts against lgbt . well then , did the germans who are not nazis , those who actually love and accept the jews , gas the jews by association as well ? just because they are germans even though they hold completely different beliefs ? there is a fundamental difference between a church that teaches homosexuality is not wrong . do not discriminate . god made lgbtq people this way . love one another despite differences . and a church that teaches homosexuality is unnatural . god hates homosexuals . it is an illness that can be cured . there is a fundamental difference between a group that accepts lgbt people and a group that actively holds anti lgbt campaigns and conversion therapy . i m curious as to why you would call out the former , and go as far as to say you re not particularly interested in other groups . it s almost as if you don t have an issue with anti lgbt , and your intention is to propagate falsehoods about religion . furthermore , support for 377a isn t exactly anti lgbt . if that s the case then shouldn t you call it sexist because it only applies to men ? anti lgbt would be opposing pinkdot , an event that supports all lgbtq people . has the local catholic or angelican church engaged in opposing pinkdot ? have they engaged in the wear white movement ? have they engaged in conversion therapy ? are they , as you claim , the biggest group that are anti lgbt ? if yes , where are your sources ?

"it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter ."," it is not marriage calling something marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order established by god , one sins and offends god . same sex marriage does just this . accordingly , anyone who professes to love god must be opposed

the idea of censoring media that promotes or glamorizes lgbt issues hosts the problem of whether media showing homosexuality as a normal occurrence constitutes as promoting or glamorizing .,"i would like to write about why i think google is doing something that s great for singapore . google has effectively helped several of the problems that lgbt citizens face in singapore the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship , and the lack of resources for grassroots movements in singapore to happen effectively . the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship lgbt media in singapore suffers from significant censorship and lgbt citizens have little say in how their life is fairly portrayed in mainstream media . compare and contrast the two different events below in 2006 , brokeback mountain passed completely uncensored into singapore . http news . bbc . co . uk 2 hi entertainment 4716610 . stm however , in 2007 , we have censorship of gay sex scenes in a small local movie festival . http pluralsg . wordpress . com 2007 04 24 gay sex scenes in local movie solos censored although i may stand corrected on the details , the article mentions that more graphic scenes that were not lgbt generally passed uncensored . but the biggest problem i have is with the guidelines on lgbt censorship in singapore . this problem can be seen directly from the bbc article on brokeback mountain singapore s media content director said ang lee s film was passed as it did not promote or glamorise the lifestyle . the idea of censoring media that promotes or glamorizes lgbt issues hosts the problem of whether media showing homosexuality as a normal occurrence constitutes as promoting or glamorizing . for example , the bbc article references that but in 2004 , taiwanese film formula 17 , which was about two teenage boys falling in love , was banned because it portrayed homosexuality as normal , and a natural progression of society . you can see that the reason for censorship is completely different the movie was censored because it showed someone living a normal lgbt life if you could somehow call it that way . and if you seriously consider something innocuous as this as a promotion or glamorization of lgbt lifestyles , then honestly , what exactly can pass the censors for lgbt citizens to get their message across that lgbt citizens are people too ? either way , the directive for censorship is incredibly vague and leaves plenty of room for the censor boards to do whatever they want , or the censor boards are simply being inconsistent with their censoring . these are both troubling conclusions . the lack of resources in grassroots movements in singapore for those in this thread who are worried that google is simply using its corporate clout to lobby the singapore government , the article states that that s not what google is trying to do their strategy involves developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . http dot429 . com articles 2012 07 06 google wants the world to legalize love google s strategy is not so much of lobbying the government directly so much as developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . i find this heartening because i ve attended lgbt support groups in singapore and see that they are sorely lacking on funds to do something impactful . the people who work there are definitely passionate about improving the lives of lgbt singaporeans a key part of oogachaga one of the support groups is to provide support for lgbt singaporeans to re connect with their families because of the fear of being ostracized when coming out . while i think this a great cause to support that appeals to the family first mentality of singaporeans , they don t have quite the funds to extend their reach to most singaporeans . considering the last event i went to had about 25 young adults attend , this is really small when you consider that singapore has more than 4 million citizens . google and barclays were the largest sponsors of pink dot 2012 a grassroots movement that has become very successful , although it s an event where 99 of the participants are lgbt citizens . i went to the last one and although there were supporting families who came , they were few and far between . conclusion overall , i think the move by google and the support provided by citi and ernst young gives me some hope that same sex rights can be established in my generation . i think that progress can happen faster than people think it could the most important step is for citizens to talk about it openly and proponents of same sex rights to not be afraid of backlash to their jobs and familial relationships . google is definitely helping here .

"one argument is based on the view that being transgender is a mental illness , and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service .","since you are too lazy to read the link you yourself sent , i ll copy and paste it here for you there are arguments against the inclusion of transgender people in military service . one argument is based on the view that being transgender is a mental illness , and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service . 1 this argument follows a high incidence of depression and suicide manifest in transgender individuals . this is especially pertinent in individuals who have had sex reassignment surgery and are unsatisfied with the results in such cases severe depression is prevalent . 5 hormone therapy can affect mood and a sense of well being , a factor that counts against inclusion of transgender people and its effect on service capability . 5 besides the well being argument of hormone treatment , complications may arise due to hormone treatments . possible complications arising from estrogen and testosterone therapies include an increased risk of thromboembolic disease , myocardial infarction , breast cancer , fertility problems , stroke , abnormal liver function , renal disease , endometrial cancer , and osteoporosis . 6 any of these could cause significant issues to effective military service , especially when deployed in remote areas or in field training settings . another concern is the cost to treat transgender members in the military . a small portion of transgender soldiers seek medical intervention , yearly 30 to 140 pursue hormone treatment and 25 to 100 have surgical reassignment surgery . it is estimated that a male to female transition can cost between us 7 , 000 and 24 , 000 female to male transition can exceed us 50 , 000 . 7 the defense department s yearly budget for healthcare is 6 billion , the numbers found in the study show the cost to treat service members with gd would fall between 2 . 4 million and 8 . 4 million , that is . 04 to . 14 percent of the military s annual healthcare budget . 8 a further argument is that in order to have an effective , smooth running military , there must be cohesion within the unit . it is argued that transgender individuals would have a negative impact on unit cohesion . the bonds of trust among individual service members are vital . 9 there is a fear that if transgender personnel be allowed to serve openly , morale will be detrimentally affected . but this argument neglects to deal with the question of what kinds of structural accommodations might be needed to maintain morale and unit cohesion in such situations . military service forces members into very intimate living quarters . requiring members to live in situations that make them feel disconcerted and uncomfortable may result in their performance being undermined . 1 6 ",19-01-2021 17:53,Reddit,mental illness,-1
"that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform .","when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021

are we seriously arguing to make life harder for them and risk the mental health of transyouth because 1 5 might detransition ?,"i think one issue is that currently , the minority is not even being protected lgbt doesn t get proper legal protection and that this sounds like penalizing a marginalized minority group even further for the off chance that a member of the majority who mistaken themself as being part of the minority regrets it . it basically feels like it s saying transpeople don t deserve to get the treatment they need because if they do , a cisperson who thinks they re trans might end up regretting which is also super rare given the amount of hoops you have to go through just to transition via public route . same with trans minorities who suffer from regret , should not be forgotten because the numbers are low . however , transpeople are alr been neglected because the numbers are low and also because cannot import culture war . are we seriously arguing to make life harder for them and risk the mental health of transyouth because 1 5 might detransition ? take note that a large number of detransitioners do so due to discrimination or lack of support , making those who do so due to regret around 0 . 2 0 . 5 . if this was some other medical treatment , everyone would be happy to let it be we have people happy to undergo surgeries with higher risks . so why the double standard when it comes to transitioning ?

the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different .," it is not marriage calling something marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order established by god , one sins and offends god . same sex marriage does just this . accordingly , anyone who professes to love god must be opposed to it . marriage is not the creature of any state . rather , it was established by god in paradise for our first parents , adam and eve . as we read in the book of genesis god created man in his image in the divine image he created him male and female he created them . god blessed them , saying be fertile and multiply fill the earth and subdue it . gen . 1 28 29 the same was taught by our savior jesus christ from the beginning of the creation , god made them male and female . for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife . mark 10 6 7 . genesis also teaches how god punished sodom and gomorrah for the sin of homosexuality the lord rained down sulphurous fire upon sodom and gomorrah . he overthrew those cities and the whole plain , together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil . gen . 19 24 25 ",11-06-2015 10:18,Reddit,same sex

"in 2018 , india s highest court unanimously struck down part of section 377 of the indian penal code , which outlaws same sex relations , following 17 years of legal challenges mounted by activists ."," cna explains the history of 377a and how some countries have repealed it when was 377a introduced and why ? section 377a was introduced to singapore s penal code in the middle of 1938 when it was under british rule . it reads any male person who , in public or private , commits , or abets the commission of , or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of , any act of gross indecency with another male person , shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years . the law was generally believed to have derived from the british government s desire to safeguard public morality by prohibiting homosexual activity in the straits settlements . however , documents from the british national archives that were declassified in 2014 and 2016 reveal that section 377a was originally intended to curtail the spread of male prostitution , and not consensual private sexual acts between men . these were brought to light in 2019 by a legal team that sought to repeal the law . the documents showed that male prostitution was a widespread problem in the area at the time , especially among british civil servants . this eventually led section 377a to be passed in the legislative council of the straits settlements , and was later inherited by singapore . however , the origins of section 377a stretch back to 1860 , when it was first codified as section 377 in the indian penal code by the british empire as carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animal . it was then exported to at least 39 british colonies across asia , the pacific islands and africa . penalties range from two to 20 years in prison but in places that have also implemented sharia law , lgbt people can also face more severe punishment such as flogging . which countries have repealed the law , and which have not ? former british colonies that have repealed the legislation include india , seychelles and fiji . in 2018 , india s highest court unanimously struck down part of section 377 of the indian penal code , which outlaws same sex relations , following 17 years of legal challenges mounted by activists . in the landmark judgment , india s supreme court ruled that it was unconstitutional in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex . criminalising carnal intercourse under section 377 of the indian penal code is irrational , indefensible and manifestly arbitrary , said then chief justice dipak misra in his delivery of the unanimous verdict on sep 6 , 2018 . evolving social attitudes towards lgbt issues have also been attributed to the repealing of 377 . in 2011 , india included a third gender category in addition to the male and female options in its census forms for the first time . bhutan decriminalised homosexuality last year , making it legal to have gay sex and easing restrictions on same sex relationships . the move by the majority buddhist nation of 800 , 000 people came after other asian countries including india and nepal relaxed restrictions on the rights of lgbt people . according to researchers , much of bhutan s penal code was adopted from us laws . however , there are parts about sodomy and unnatural sex , which appear to be identical to language in other penal codes around south asia that was copied from the indian penal code . besides singapore , former british colonies where 377 continues to exist in various forms include malaysia , brunei , pakistan , bangladesh , sri lanka and myanmar . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",19-08-2022 17:12,Reddit,same sex,1

case by case basis ."," because as it stands in the west right now , there transgender cases keep coming at us younger and younger . yeah . i think it s an improvement , because it means that such kids feel safe to say so at that age . from personal experience as a trans guy , i was already struggling with dysphoria from my first year at kindergarten so age 3 or 4 . i didn t have the words for it then , other than that being a girl or treated as one felt fundamentally wrong and i didn t know why . but even by that age i was aware that it was not something it was ok to say christian family , even though i cried about it a lot and my parents didn t know what was wrong . for the most part i could ignore it though , until puberty , when that sense of wrongness went into overdrive and just kept getting worse and worse until i finally caved and transitioned . i m definitely not alone when it comes to trans adults who had similar feelings from very young ages . usually around kindergarten when they first started being aware that there were boys and girls , and that the one they were supposed to be just felt wrong . in a more liberal environment , it s possible some of us would have said so at that age . social psychologist dr david canter said no one should be assigned the label transgender before puberty . if the child is unhappy then the reasons should be explored without assigning labels . i fully agree with this . though this is also before puberty . once puberty hits , for many trans people the wrong body feeling either begins or starts greatly intensifying and is very unlikely to reverse . i d say never , but there may be exceptions . those are usually the ones who start seeking medical intervention and are very unlikely to regret it . the few such regret cases i know of changed their minds for religious political reasons . for others who don t experience that distress , they might benefit from waiting until they re older and more sure . they may also realise that they re trans but don t feel dysphoric over their bodies . and if medical professionals are preaching caution and advocating for age 18 , i m inclined to believe them . for hrt , the advised age is 16 . 18 or 21 for any sex reassignment surgery depending on country and procedure . puberty blockers are used for those under 16 who are assessed to be suitable for treatment , or where the youth wants more time to be sure before committing to either male or female puberty . in cases of severe gender dysphoria , and or where regret is unlikely such as if they ve been living happily as that gender since childhood like jazz jennings , hrt may begin at younger ages on a case by case basis . from reading doctor s responses from other articles it always gives me the impression they re preaching caution , but are careful not to commit to a full no , or they are unwilling to talk about this issue unfiltered . possibly the latter for some , but the cautious approach is the official stance from medical authorities like the apa . they advise a step by step approach and not pressuring the child into one identity or another , as well as acting on a harm reduction basis . i . e . if a child is constantly crying and extremely distressed about not being allowed to do feminine things , then let them do feminine things and see if that helps . it doesn t mean they re a trans girl . but neither should the parents insist that they act like a boy and force them to do masculine activities . likewise if the kid prefers wearing dresses , or having long hair , or being called by a female name . maybe it s a phase they ll eventually grow out of , or he s just a feminine guy , or maybe she ll turn out to be a trans girl when puberty comes around . it doesn t mean letting them do anything they want , but rather not unnecessarily forcing gender norms on a kid when that s clearly causing them psychological harm , and remaining open to the possibilities that the kid might or might not be trans . let s just say assuming we discover transgenderism is a biological phenomenon in the future there s actually robust scientific support for that , much more than sexual orientation . at this point we re sure that biology definitely plays some part , and it s just a question of how much . we still need to acknowledge the power of the environment , which is what many liberal , virtue signaling parents are doing to their children right now . perhaps , but definitely not in singapore . i generally don t like using the west as an example for social things because our cultures and laws are very different . for example , singaporeans are much more obedient and don t dare to cause trouble by suing people or starting protests , even when we re upset , and the same applies to those of us who are trans . even overseas , i do think that stereotype is not truly reflective of reality .

several legal challenges against 377a have been heard in the courts over the years .," mediacorp apologises for tv drama containing negative gay stereotypes singapore national broadcaster mediacorp has apologised for a tv drama containing negative stereotypes of gay people following a backlash from its viewers and the lgbtq community . in response to social media posts criticising channel 8 drama my guardian angels , mediacorp said in a statement that it had no intention to disrespect or discriminate against any persons or community in the drama . we are sorry if we have offended anyone or caused any distress . we have heard your feedback and will continue to exercise vigilance and be more mindful in our portrayal of characters , said mediacorp . yahoo lifestyle sea first reported about netizens criticism of channel 8 and mediacorp regarding the chinese language drama on 3 july . the show features characters displaying homophobic behaviour , and a male paedophilic character who has a sexually transmitted disease . mediacorp s apology follows an earlier one from actor chase tan , who played the paedophilic character . tan apologised for causing distress to the lgbtq community because of the character . see tan s full apology here . singapore s broadcasting rules do not allow content that has positive portrayals of lgbtq people or promotes homosexual lifestyles . the furore over the tv show began two weeks ago after gay business owner teo yu sheng posted comments criticising the drama on the instagram account of his queer brand , heckin unicorn . teo , 29 , highlighted storylines and scenes in my guardian angels , which he said promote false negative perceptions of the lgbtq community . one character , a basketball coach played by chase tan , molests a teenage boy in one of the scenes . in a separate scene , another boy is shown as having sores , indicating that he is infected with a sexually transmitted disease by the coach . in other scenes , characters played by kym ng and brandon wong behave in a homophobic manner . the two actors play a couple in my guardian angels . the 30 episode series , aired on channel 8 in april and may , is still available for viewing on youtube and mediacorp s streaming service , mewatch . the show also stars zoe tay , pierre png , hong ling , chen tianwen , jin yin ji , benjamin tan , edwin goh and fang rong . criticisms of the show s homophobic scenes spread on various social media platforms , including instagram , twitter and reddit . netizens have written numerous comments in the instagram accounts of mediacorp and channel 8 , calling for the company to apologise for causing harm and distress to the lgbtq community . chase tan and fellow actors kym ng and brandon wong were singled out by netizens for their roles in the tv series , which perpetuate negative perceptions of lgbtq people such as gay men being sexual predators . they also pointed out that such depictions of queer people are not balanced by positive portrayals in local media . advocacy group action for aids afa also criticised mediacorp in a statement last week , saying that the tv series perpetuates false stereotypes about gay people , which create further suffering among an already marginalised and stigmatised population . afa said there is no evidence that homosexual males have a greater propensity to offend against children than heterosexual males , and sexually transmitted diseases can affect anyone and are not confined to any gender identity , sexual orientation or behaviour . commenting on mediacorp s apology , teo said , i m glad that mediacorp has finally mustered the courage to apologise , though it s disappointing that it took them so long to do so . but an apology also isn t enough i hope that mediacorp can pledge to stop creating negative portrayals of the lgbtq community from now onwards . taking real action is the only true form of apology . an afa spokesperson told yahoo lifestyle sea , the apology from mediacorp is a good start . however , what action for aids would like to see is mediacorp taking their role as a credible , national broadcaster seriously and this needs to include being able to have programming that does not set out to demonise any community in singapore . activists have said lgbtq people in singapore suffer persistent discrimination and stigma . sex between men is illegal under section 377a of the penal code . the authorities have said the law is not actively enforced but is still in place to reflect the moral views of the conservative majority . several legal challenges against 377a have been heard in the courts over the years . three such cases were dismissed by the high court in march this year . read more singapore s lgbtq voters call on election

"also , the next generation of those 30 support lgbt rights ."," questioning why my embracement even matter to the lgbtq community when it have zero effect on me . that s essentially the crux of the issue . i never questioned your prerogative to not embrace it , but why is it not a valid question as to why your unwillingness to embrace something should restrict the rights of others . ? goes on mentioning that it isn t a mental illness when i didn t even say it is . did i ever attribute that claim to you ? the point is that there are two definitions of normal commonly used , and homosexuality is biologically normal under one of them . and back to guilt tripping me to further your agenda of leagalizing same sex marriage . if you feel guilt , then it s on you . which part of my post even entails that ? or maybe you are taking it too personally ? am i gaslit ing you or are you already in your own pre formed bubble refusing to even bother acknowledging other s concerns ? you didn t bring up any concerns . in all your prior posts , you ve actually yet to give a single reason as to why members of the lgbt community should not be afforded equal rights . so by not repealing 377a , you take it as a sign that it is there to promote discrimination towards lgbtq , even though it is publicly acknowledged that they will not actively enforce it ? it s pretty obvious to anyone paying the slightest bit of attention that 377a is not being repealed to pander to those opposed to lgbt rights . so yes , i don t disagree . however , kids tend to form their identity based on environmental cues . how sure can one be that by normal ising lgbtq community , it would not lead to negative and unfavourable outcomes on the upbringing of our next generation ? 1 virtually every country that has legalized same sex marriage has not seen those issues , whatever they might be . 2 i went to church weekly and was raised in a conservative christian household with literally no pro lgbt influences . i turned out gay . point is , i have yet to see anything to remotely suggest that growing up in a pro lgbt rights environment or otherwise affects one s sexuality . 3 the current discrimination and stigma against homosexuality already causes those negative outcomes to members of the lgbt community . 4 our next generation already comprise of a significant majority that support lgbt rights https lkyspp . nus . edu . sg docs default source ips ips working paper 34 religion morality and conservatism in singapore . pdf . can you point out what unfavorable outcomes they ve experienced ? what other concerns do you have ? if by standing against legalising of same sex marriage is a form of discrimination , then i guess that you ve represented your community well by removing the middle ground so that we have to choose to support lgbtq community or discriminate the community . there are plenty of people who are undecided or don t care either way . that s the middle ground . saying that you vehemently oppose something is literally taking a side and doesn t actually construe the middle ground . also , the next generation of those 30 support lgbt rights . your views against same sex marriage would absolutely not make you a moderate within that generation . it is only a spade because you are too obsessed with getting people to view it from your point of view than to take a step back and view it objectively . that s how you miss a beautiful garden . yes , sorry that i m obsessed with trying to get people to stop promoting discrimination against myself . also , what beautiful garden is this ? the one that treats a minority group with bigotry ? sorry , i guess we have a different definition for what beautiful actually means . just some food for a thought , you kept mentioning rights here and there but you couldn t list out those rights . i have mentioned them multiple times start with lifting the excessive censorship towards the lgbt community , then repeal 377a and then move on to same sex marriage adoption . along the way , one s sexual orientation should also be afforded the same protections we afford one s race or religious beliefs . which of those are unreasonable ? what deleterious outcomes do you think they will cause ? and being widely accepted as one . those things are widely accepted as rights in many countries . heck , even countries like taiwan , japan and india are more progressive in that regard , so there goes the whole asian values argument .

"and if the answer is anything other than explaining how human rights should be upheld , with some practical discussions on ironing out the small issues that certain laws or stances have , then why should we care about your feelings lol"," even if you sit out , this isn t a debate about chocolate vs vanilla ice cream . as much as people can claim to be indifferent , it has to be acknowledged that to be indifferent when injustice is occurring is to be complicit . if you were to be indifferent to , and ignore lgbtq people , once we at least legally have the same rights or somewhere near that , it wouldn t have the same connotation as being indifferent now . when love , simon was labelled r21 , a rating that includes the likes of fifty shades , just because two teen boys had an on screen kiss , you can t say that this injustice doesn t exist . and to simplify it , you say that you don t like having ideology shoved down your throat right . well , lgbtq people don t like having discrimination against them written into the law , being unable to make healthcare decisions for your kids or partner just because your partner is of the same gender as you , etc . from your general stance i believe that you think people should be allowed to make their own decisions so long as they don t harm others right ? but conservatives and the government are harming lgbtq people . which is why to say that you are indifferent gets you this kind of reaction . because to insinuate that we should have to get you to care , in essence pander to you , just to have basic rights is insulting . because the only reason we are being loud is because our right to be individuals and ourselves is being undermined . practically , would it help us to pander to the supposed middle ground of apathetic people ? perhaps . but that sends the message that we have to beg to be accepted , when actually it s the other way around . people should stop discriminating . put it this way , you talk a lot about legitimate concerns . but if you don t inherently see the discrimination against people purely because of sexual orientation as wrong and a legitimate concern , i m afraid to say that you are part of the issue . if you really want to discuss practical concerns with the majority of people who see lgbtq people as deserving of not being discriminated against , you first have to see discrimination as a concern . anyways , i don t know what exactly you said that caused you to be dragged , but take this as another perspective . remember also that no matter how objectively you look at it , lgbtq people are not supporting anti religion or idk anti conservative laws ? but those groups are supporting anti lgbtq legislation . lgbtq people are the persecuted group here . to say that the buzz lightyear debacle turned you off to an lgbtq person , is on a much lower level somewhat like you telling a jew that the holocaust turned you off and perhaps they should have considered endearing themselves to the middle ground germans . tactless enough to warrant bashing to some people evidently . ask yourself this what would it take for us to gain your support ? and if the answer is anything other than explaining how human rights should be upheld , with some practical discussions on ironing out the small issues that certain laws or stances have , then why should we care about your feelings lol",24-07-2022 17:59,Reddit,rights,1

"at the end of the day , the significant , and material issue is that you are opposed to their equal rights ."," you still haven t answered my question . by your logic , both are anti lgbt . okay let s assume your stance that the difference is a minor degree , even so , the fact that you are in defence of calling out the group that is slightly less critical instead of the group that is the most critical , is beyond me . the only logical reason i can think of this is you are trying to stir shit . since you basically repeat this point over and over , i ll just address your post as a whole . first , i m not stirring shit simply because i am saying stuff you don t like to hear . if i were stirring shit , i would have trotted out the usual talking points about the catholic church being full of paedophile priests etc . , but i don t . i m making a rather focused and factual statement about the church being anti lgbt . and let s not get lost in semantics here , both the catholic church and protestant chuches are anti lgbt . the catholic church is anti lgbt . that s just a statement of fact . the church has opposed repealing 377a , it has preemptively already said that it will oppose gay marriage . the church is almost never going to have an open gay priest , or preside over gay marriages . i m not stereotyping or misrepresenting when i say the catholic church and protestant churches are anti lgbt . that s just a statement of the positions of the two churches on this issue , and it s factually correct . you seem to be saying that hang on , the protestants are way worse ! they have their wear white campaign , and pray that it will rain on pink dot . sure . i have no problems accepting that the protestants are probably worse . but see this is why it s just a matter of degree both groups are still anti lgbt , one group is just worse . this is also why the comparison between muslims and isis is a strawman unlike the situation where both catholics and protestants are anti lgbti , muslims and isis are not both terrorist organisations . the difference between muslims and isis is more than simply a matter of degree . now , to the lgbt person , most actually honestly don t care whatever theological views churches have on lgbt issues . lgbt people just want to be able to lead their lives freely and equally , like the rest of society . in order for this to happen , the most important change that needs to occur is in the change of laws , and giving lgbt people access to rights such as marriage . if you oppose that , quite honestly lgbt people aren t that bothered whether your opposition is based on love and understanding , or clear homophobia . at the end of the day , the significant , and material issue is that you are opposed to their equal rights . that s the most significant issue . you can insist till you are blue in the face that your opposition is more enlightened or less bullying , but at the end of the day , you still oppose lgbt equal rights . so yes , sure , wear white etc is worse than what the catholic church has done , but on the significant question on whether any of these very wealthy and influential organisations are going to oppose equal rights for lgbt people and here i refer to rights beyond simply 377a , but gay marriage and so on , sorry , the catholic church is very much in the same camp as the protestants .

"gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children .","when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021 19:59,Reddit,trans,0

also i havent encounter any early church fathers writing that kinda approve healthy homosexual relationship it s not likely that any of them did .,"my beliefs on homosexuality were previously the same as yours . i changed it as a result of years of research and debating others , rather than from trying to find evidence to support an existing view . so i dont see any debates about this can be fruitful . we don t have to look just at the text itself . jesus said we can know things by their fruit . the traditional teaching on homosexuality has led to a lot of bad fruit , and that is reason to question it . also i havent encounter any early church fathers writing that kinda approve healthy homosexual relationship it s not likely that any of them did . most gay sex back then involved male soldiers raping their defeated enemies or young boys sold as sex slaves , so it would be more worrying if they weren t against that . there was no notion of a healthy homosexual relationship . most heterosexual relationships weren t that healthy either , especially in a society where women were seen as property and marriage had more to do with money and politics than love . before the 19th century , there was no widespread concept of someone who might be naturally inclined towards the same sex . the assumption was that everyone was attracted to the opposite sex , but some people decided to have gay sex because their lusts were particularly perverse or extreme . criticising that and calling for healthy sexual moderation e . g . within marriage is completely different from denying gay people any form of sexual expression whatsoever . for me personally the calling of someone with homosexual attraction is to be celibate . in his book god and the gay christian , matthew vines wrote that while grappling with the morality of homosexuality was fairly new in christian theology , celibacy was something that had been studied and debated in depth from early christian history . it was the consenus of theologians over the centuries that forced celibacy was unbiblical and spiritually destructive , and to enforce that on anyone would be morally wrong . celibacy is given to some as a gift . it is not and was never meant to be the default for any group of people . in that sense , requiring celibacy for gay people would actually be going against more of christian tradition than allowing gay marriage would be , even though that may seem counterintuitive . for another slightly different take , the late christian theologian and ethicist lewis b . smedes wrote this essay like the wideness of the sea http www . archives . soulforce . org 1998 01 01 like the wideness of the sea in 1998 , which was seminal in the discussion of lgbt inclusion within the christian church . he argues that while same sex unions may not have been part of god s original design , they are the best and most moral option for gay christians in a broken world , and god s grace covers them as well .

this is because in their minds they have this false belief that 377a means such people are illegal .,"if you read some of the hate group material , like that in we are against pink dot they often mention 377a as a reason they can treat lgbtq people badly . this is because in their minds they have this false belief that 377a means such people are illegal . of course their belief is wrong , but as long as they can hold up 377a as a card then they have that non religious reason . 377a causes discrimination in other ways by blocking efforts to create meaningful anti discrimination legislation , for example . also , for example , are instances of lgbtq people being raped or attacked or robbed and if they confront their attackers then they ve heard things like 377a says you re illegal so you ll be afraid to go to the police . also even without hearing such things 377a does make some lgbtq people afraid of reporting crimes to the police for fear of being investigated for 377a violations themselves . the same fear of discrimination caused by 377a occurs when trying to access healthcare . also some lgbtq people have been told that they cannot visit their long term partners in hospital because they re not family or because 377a says you re not a family depending on how the people working in the hospital think about 377a and if they consume the material in those hate groups . all of these reasons are why 377a must go . getting rid of 377a will make a noticeable improvement , it won t remove all discrimination and problems , but it will greatly help .

my beliefs on homosexuality were previously the same as yours .,"my beliefs on homosexuality were previously the same as yours . i changed it as a result of years of research and debating others , rather than from trying to find evidence to support an existing view . so i dont see any debates about this can be fruitful . we don t have to look just at the text itself . jesus said we can know things by their fruit . the traditional teaching on homosexuality has led to a lot of bad fruit , and that is reason to question it . also i havent encounter any early church fathers writing that kinda approve healthy homosexual relationship it s not likely that any of them did . most gay sex back then involved male soldiers raping their defeated enemies or young boys sold as sex slaves , so it would be more worrying if they weren t against that . there was no notion of a healthy homosexual relationship . most heterosexual relationships weren t that healthy either , especially in a society where women were seen as property and marriage had more to do with money and politics than love . before the 19th century , there was no widespread concept of someone who might be naturally inclined towards the same sex . the assumption was that everyone was attracted to the opposite sex , but some people decided to have gay sex because their lusts were particularly perverse or extreme . criticising that and calling for healthy sexual moderation e . g . within marriage is completely different from denying gay people any form of sexual expression whatsoever . for me personally the calling of someone with homosexual attraction is to be celibate . in his book god and the gay christian , matthew vines wrote that while grappling with the morality of homosexuality was fairly new in christian theology , celibacy was something that had been studied and debated in depth from early christian history . it was the consenus of theologians over the centuries that forced celibacy was unbiblical and spiritually destructive , and to enforce that on anyone would be morally wrong . celibacy is given to some as a gift . it is not and was never meant to be the default for any group of people . in that sense , requiring celibacy for gay people would actually be going against more of christian tradition than allowing gay marriage would be , even though that may seem counterintuitive . for another slightly different take , the late christian theologian and ethicist lewis b . smedes wrote this essay like the wideness of the sea http www . archives . soulforce . org 1998 01 01 like the wideness of the sea in 1998 , which was seminal in the discussion of lgbt inclusion within the christian church . he argues that while same sex unions may not have been part of god s original design , they are the best and most moral option for gay christians in a broken world , and god s grace covers them as well .

"on the flip side , of the 44 supporting 377a , only a fraction would also go to the extent of supporting it politically and socially .","it s a shift for a survey , it looks promising , on paper . but , whether a survey preference could be transferred into something political or into actions , that s not guaranteed . supporting not supporting something politically and socially is a lot more steps beyond saying i support don t support in a survey form . just because someone might say that 377a has no place in sg in a survey , it doesn t mean they would go out and exert pressure for change . 36 of respondents , a very significant number , is so apathetic that they wouldn t even give a yes no answer to a possibly anonymised ? survey . of the 20 that do not support 377a , there will presumably be a fraction that would not go to the extent of politically and socially opposing it . on the flip side , of the 44 supporting 377a , only a fraction would also go to the extent of supporting it politically and socially . so , by and large , singapore might still lack strong political interest in the matter to prompt serious discussion or even change in the near future . to be honest , singaporeans in general do not have the reputation of strongly supporting social causes . perhaps due to the focus of our education and asian upbringing , people can be generally apathetic . of course this is changing but this will also take time . without sufficiently strong pressure , especially from a strong core of people with strong opinions on the issue , there is not a lot of political impetus to visit this issue . because , if most people do not care to make a stance , then by default , the status quo will have the advantage . while this survey gave some interesting change in trends , what is also important is whether there is an equivalent and significant change in core supporters of repeal . what is also interesting would be the trend of the strength of core supporters of 377a . the swing is definitely not linear that goes from 55 to 44 to 0 in 16 years 4 x 4 years at rate of 11 per 4 years . at some point it would plateau due to strong supporters for 377a . it s not like repeal will be guaranteed to shoot up 8 every 4 years to 50 in 15 years . for all we know , repeal might shoot up fast initially but taper off quickly as people can t be bothered . where is equilibrium lies and low long it takes to reach that is quite unpredictable . so , my point is , it s already hard to tell when would repeal gain the upper hand over support . it s also hard to tell just how apathetic singaporeans are to this issue . this survey tells very little about those key parameters that would predict how things turn out in the not so distant future . i won t deny it , this survey is a good news for you . but , frankly , it s not the kind of news that gives you confidence to bet everything on it . it s still baby steps , and of course baby steps are better than none .

no one s saying homosexuality is a fabrication .,"apologies for a day late reply , was busy . there s alot of angsty downvoters who don t even dare to participate in discourse . you guys are the definition of circlejerk , and the reason why we can t have nice discussions on reddit , grow up please . singapore is a secular nation . marriage is not a religious one but a civil institution as per singaporean law . churches will also not be forced as it is in the us to perform same sex marriages . i never said we weren t a secular nation . i wholly agree we are a secular nation , and i detest people on the white shirt camp who invoke the bible to denounce gay marriage because it s against their beliefs . yes , churches will not be forced , but in the us , those who upset the gay community will face huge budget cuts , threatening their very survival . technically , they are still allowed to reject the marriage of gay couples . while facing minor consequences of course . can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being discriminated against i don t believe in discriminating against gay people . i treat them as fellow human beings . those who discriminate against them are doing so out of fear , and i abhor such practice . would anyone be fine with not having equal rights ? i assume the right you are talking about is the right to marry . this really frustrates me . marriage isn t a right , it s a privilege . which is why in singapore or anywhere in the civilised world , both parties must consent before a marriage licence can be issued . if marriage regardless of the sex was truly a right , we d have a shit ton of problems . we don t have the right to marry animals for example . and this privilege is decided by the state . proponents of gay marriage always argue that marriage is a social construct . this lends even more credibility to the argument that marriage is not something we should inherently be given , it is simply a privilege and a standard we humans have invented , and set to adhere to . are they advocating that christians be stripped of their basic rights a group that actively calls for another to have less rights again , marriage is not a right . unless you are talking about the right to be an individual , the right to be treated as a fellow human being . then what i have written above already addresses this . i don t think the majority of white shirts are advocating discrimination of gays , those who do are the religious zealots , and a convenient straw man for the pro pink dot to attack . would you give anti vaxxers or climate change deniers the same legitimacy these are debates that are fundamentally different in the fact that they do not involve social constructs . let me explain further . we don t give anti vaxxers legitimacy because it is scientifically untrue . if white shirts argued that homosexuality is unnatural , i wouldn t be giving them any legitimacy either , because it has already been scientifically proven it does occur in nature . however , the issue at hand is whether homosexuals should be granted marriage . and this is a social construct , something that science has little authority in . therefore yes , we have to grant the anti gay movement legitimacy because this isn t a science debate , this is a social debate that involves an institutional standard we have believed in and referenced for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . no one s saying homosexuality is a fabrication . but people are saying that marriage should not be extended to include homosexuality . people have followed the traditional construct of marriage for hundreds of years , and allowing homoesexuals to marry on the basis of sexual attraction trivialises this institution . think of it as christianity and buddhism if a bunch of buddhists decided to mix the 2 beliefs together and then proceed to tell christians that they should expand their definition of christianity to include them , aggressively asserting that it is their right to be recognised by christianity while calling others who oppose them as bigots and narrow minded , most people would disagree . because in this scenario you shouldn t be trying to identify with a religion , you have essentially created your own . coincidentally you brought up the point about being antagonistic , but can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being told their narrow minded definitions of marriage should coalesce with the idea of same sex marriage something born out of sexual attraction ? i haven t once invoked a non secular argument , and i believe that the secular case against gay marriage can be made . edit formatting",11-06-2016 22:56,Reddit,homosexuality,0

"many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men ."," government considering best way forward on 377a , will respect different viewpoints shanmugam court s decision consistent with past position on 377a mr shanmugam noted that successive court judgments over the years have consistently taken the position that these are highly contentious social issues and within the province of parliament . the heterosexual stable family remains a stable norm , he added . the current legal position reflects our society s norms , values and attitudes . that s what the courts have said . in its judgment , the court noted that the compromise which singapore has struck , in respect to section 377a , is unique , said mr shanmugam . our approach strikes a balance between preserving the legislative status quo , whilst accommodating the concerns of those directly affected by the legislation . the court recognised that the government did this in order to avoid driving a deeper wedge within our society , he added . it also noted that singapore s approach seeks to keep what to do with section 377a within the democratic space . socially charged issues , such as section 377a , call for continued discussion and open ended resolution within the political domain , where we can forge consensus , rather than in win lose outcomes in court . in this way , we can accommodate divergent interests , avoid polarisation and facilitate incremental change , said mr shanmugam . additionally , the court highlighted the importance of creating space for peaceful co existence among various groups , especially since the balance between the various interests around section 377a has grown more delicate . these opinions align with the approach that the government has taken in dealing with section 377a , and that it intends to take as it considers the changes in our social landscape since 2007 . in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong said in parliament , when the penal code was amended but section 377a left unchanged , that we want to be a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society , said mr shanmugam . mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin . this remains our stand today , added mr shanmugam . our emphases on gradual evolution and on traditional families remain constant . shifting attitudes towards homosexuality however , since the issue was last discussed in parliament in 2007 , social attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted , mr shanmugam acknowledged . one of the things that upsets the lgbt community is that many feel that their experience of being hurt or rejected by their families , friends , schools , companies is not recognised , indeed often denied . at the same time , a large majority want to preserve the overall tone of our society , said mr shanmugam . in particular , the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman , and that children should be raised within such a family structure . their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family . many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men . both these viewpoints are valid and important , he added . live and let live approach noting that these are deeply divisive issues , mr shanmugam said that is why the government takes a live and let live approach . we seek to be an inclusive society , where mutual respect and tolerance for different views and practices are paramount . government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement . and agc takes a similar approach . mr shanmugam added that the government had expressly included in the mrha maintenance of religious harmony act that any attack on lgbt groups , or on persons because they are lgbt , will be an offence , and won t be tolerated . lgbt individuals are entitled to live peacefully , without being attacked or threatened , he said . likewise , any attack on any other group , based on their religion , or religious beliefs , even if those beliefs run counter to values held by lgbt groups will not be acceptable . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",03-03-2022 16:08,Reddit,homosexual,1

so why should sexual orientation not be one of these aspects ?,"to me it s about treating everyone equally . the past 50 and more years have been about fostering cohesion between people with differences in race , language , and religion . sexual orientation , much like race , is not something to be chosen . heck , if i could , why would i not select the option that would make life easiest for me ? why would i want to live a life of discrimination and unorthodoxy ? so why should someone who has no power over this characteristic have to be disadvantaged or suffer for it ? because i am no less human and no less incapable of empathy and productivity than the next man in line . besides , the argument that children being exposed to homosexuality as a lifestyle is complete bollocks . no properly straight person would choose to marry someone they are incapable of loving romantically that is , someone of the same sex . similarly , no homosexual person with self interest would decide to play the game of life against their own welfare and commit themselves to a life with someone they cannot love . or rather , they should not be forcing themselves to do this . so in the end by not recognising the union between gay couples , by denying them the legal benefits or rights , rather of marriage , there really is nothing gained , and you lose out on a whole lot of people being happy . our government s always had such a big emphasis on equality . in race , in religion , in education . so why should sexual orientation not be one of these aspects ?

and they fare worse then ccp in terms of gay rights .,"we all know that any developed country outside of sea region and ccp does not criminalised people just becus they are specifically gendered male and have sex with each other . even india does not criminalise . thats blunt sense moronic , to criminalise something specifically based on gender . apologies if you disagree . even india moves on from the ruling many years back . the way you are putting it , its like just because other countries are doing it , we should do it too . so if other countries are abolishing or has already abolished death sentence for drug smugglers , we should blindly follow ? blind following the blind ? with out the independence of mind ? shoudn t the final outsome , even if it results in the abolishment of the act , be made with the indepencence of mind ? at least justifty your support for the abolishment of 377a with better logic . majority of these less developed sea countries will properly side ccp in the upcoming war . so you are really just associating your ideal values with them . since the early 2010s , honestly people all over the globe dont really anti male homo people anymore . why again are you mentioning about the ccp ? they are the only ones against abolishment of 377a like laws ? what about those states where gay sex is punishable by death . quite a few of them around . and they fare worse then ccp in terms of gay rights . but no mention of it from you . but just solely on ccp . i wonder why . we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war . so you are spilling over your dislike of ccp in regards to those matters to this ? if you really feel that homosexuality is immoral for the sake of so called moral values , you wouldn t even criminalise just male people , male people specifically were targeted because people who make these rules are mostly male people and are just over paranoid that without these laws and ruling , they themselves will turn homosexual . there is a term called homophobia , this is what you sound like more rather than people preaching good people values . the part in bold , that s one of the worst logic i ever heard . i mean serious ? can see you are no longer logical . not sure what you are smoking there . what next ? law makers are coming are with anti robbery laws because they are afraid they might become robbers themselves ? then they might as well not have the law and enjoy themselves by making it legal fulfilling their desires or tendencies legallly rather then fighting against their innate desires , why go through all the trouble ? as for the homesexuality part being immoral . not sure why you brought up the immoral part . a celibate homosexual is more moral than a promiscuous hetereosexual . a better way to put it is , its against nature rather then immoral . heterosexuality is part of human evolution in terms of the continuance of human population . not to mention , those body parts when in unison , were not mean to perform those task , which is why proportionally there is a higher risk of contracting stds , hiv , monkeypox , suffering from incontinence etc . in gays then heterosexuals . . because nature did not mean those body parts for that . which is why i support maintaining status quo not further tightening of the law . by that , i mean the law existing in name to permeate the state of mind that gay sex is discouraged , even though the act was no longer stricly enforced while not actually in most cases punishing gay sex itself . which is i believe the most popular sentiment among the general population excluding lgbts it would have been better to strengthen or come up protective laws against depriving gays , lgbts who are out of the closet , of job opportunities , etc . rather then repealing the act . problems is , there are people like you who like to jump to conclusions . not supporting the repealing of the act gays should be punished heavily or homophobia blah blah . of course i am not ruling out the existence of such people . but there are different schools of thought even among those who do not support the repealing of the act . some take a more aggressive stance , some take a more middle ground . regarding good values , you have good values because you support repealing of the act ? seems like quite a loose definition of good values if so . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . not sure if repealing of the act , but embedding the defintion of marriage only between man and women into the contsitution , making it not challengable in court is exactly boost the international image , attract more international investments that u define . maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . nah , i don t take it personally . hope you seriously don t too . i am also fine that you are the judge of howthose who dun support repealing of the act are , traditionalists , suck at justifying and challenging , and not being able to accept new norms . after all , delusional or not , your opinions and sentiments must be superior to those that contrast to you and it is the universal truth . and yes , i believe you are not even a pro homo person after reading your post which is not even actually pro homo .

"also , i m gonna call out the homosexuality is a choice thing , as it is proven bullshit .","saw this article and wanted to get this out of my system . the writer s arguments are anything but well thought out . they rely on fallacious arguments and non sequiturs . lets take a look from the very top . the government maintains a position that all religious communities are free to give voice to their conscience in matters that have moral impact . people of religious faith have equal right to be included in rather than dismissed from the public forum of debate . some homosexual rights advocates argue that religious citizens should refrain from arguing that the state laws should criminalise conduct that they consider immoral . this line of argument actually contradicts the definition of secularism . for what they are really saying is you shouldn t make laws based on your morality , but on mine instead . just because something is immoral to the religious i . e . a sin , doesn t mean it should be criminalised . for example , the bible raises all sorts of sins which no sane person would criminalise , such as wearing mixed cloth and worshipping other gods . on a broader point , singapore in a classical sense can never be called a pure secular state because it allows certain anomalies to exist 1 . independent schools both primary and secondary that are set up and run by religious groups e . g . acsi , sji . these schools are directly funded by the state 2 . islamic family courts system enacted in 1968 under the administration of muslim actadministers muslim personal law in legal matters governing marriages , divorces , the nullity of marriages and inheritance in singapore . 3 . the common law system underpinning our whole legal system is rooted in the judeo christian philosophical worldview . in the seventeenth century , sir matthew hale declared that the whole bible made up the common law of england . in 1767 , lord mansfield qualified this only slightly by declaring , the essential principles of revealed religion are part of the common law . oh we aren t really a secular state so we should just make our laws according to religious lines this guy . if personal enjoyment , consent , and commitment are all that is now required to declare a sexual behaviour legitimate , then there is no reasonable basis for withholding public recognition of polygamous polyamorous , adult brother sister unions or even adult adolescent unions . a quarter of the way in and this guy slippery slopes himself into legislating paedophilia , while conveniently forgetting the part where children can t consent . it is galling for singaporeans , who have seen their country progress so well to now be lectured by an elite group of liberals that they are intolerant bigots . for no other nation in human history , since empirical records have been kept , has advanced as quickly as the little island nation . despite having virtually no natural resources , singapore has gone from being a third world country in 1965 to a first world country in less than half a century . the world bank recorded that the gdp of singapore has grown 3700 from 1965 whereas the usa only grew 300 . children from the least privileged backgrounds have risen from great poverty to achieve remarkable success . acute poverty is now rare in singapore . other measures of success are equally impressive . infant mortality has been reduced faster than any other society in the last 50 years . students in singapore now top the charts consistently in international tests . for instance , the oecd ranked singaporean children number one in the world in a recent global rankingof universal basic skills in mathematics and science . yet we are told that we are backward and intolerant . economic progress ! social progress . when others call us backward and intolerant , they talk about our social policies and human rights . yet he harps on and on about things that are anything but that . this guy totally missed the point . singaporeans have made clear repeatedly that the vast majority oppose any attempts to remove s377a . this majority has likely grown over the last few decades with the growth of conservative religions , like christianity , in the wider population . for those who advocate repealing s377a we must ask what moral standards do you appeal to that will persuade us that society s current moral consensus is wrong ? if you can t persuade the majority , what gives you the right to declare by fiat that your moral code must supersede that of ours ? because the basic human rights of gays are being suppressed by these laws ? because their homesexuality does not harm others ? because we should uphold the rights of the minority , especially when said rights do not harm others ? the majority of people in singapore recognize that the homosexual lifestyle is harmful for the individual and society in general . statistics abound from all over the world to back up that statement with drug abuse , sexual transmitted diseases , depression , suicide rates disproportionately affecting those in the non heterosexual population . oh yeah , totally due to the the homosexual lifestyle , and totally not because we keep oppressing them . life expectancy is considerably lower . citation needed . this is found to be universally true even in societies where homosexuality is celebrated and encouraged . homosexuality leads to vastly inflated risks of physical and emotional harm to the individual . families and society at large are then often left to pick up the pieces of such a destructive lifestyle . . . . all the three great abrahamic religions are crystal clear that homosexuality is always a choice that can be rejected . society is replete with anecdotal evidence from both secular and religious people , who have turned their backs on the lifestyle . the weight of scientific evidence demonstrates that it is not innate or congenital , like skin colour , but rather an aspect of our freewill . the gay gene theory has been overwhelmingly debunked ! straight up lies right there . also , i m gonna call out the homosexuality is a choice thing , as it is proven bullshit . most singaporeans are suspicious that the repeal of s377a would unleash a range of thorny problems that would deeply disturb the fabric of our society . they have seen from the evidence to date in other countries that it leads to mandatory indoctrination of our children in the education system , gay adoption , gay marriage , discrimination against employees who morally disagree with the homosexual lifestyle , and flamboyant gay pride parades . some have even found themselves fined or imprisoned for opposing homosexual practice . in his 2007 speech in parliament that advocated retaining s377a , the current prime minister , mr lee hsien loong wisely noted that to change the law would result in the reality that gay activists will push for more . mr ho peng kee , then senior minister of state for home affairs in 2007 , also noted that there was an inherent danger in removing s377a . he pointed out , whilst homosexuals have a place in society , repealing section 377a will be very contentious and may send a wrong signal that government is encouraging and endorsing the homosexual lifestyle as part of our mainstream way of life . i m against repealing 377a because the government will force me and my children to be gay . this guy , basically . nothing has changed since 2007 , save for the fact that singaporeans have probably become even more religious . there is no objective evidence that the world is a better place for the diminishing of the traditional family unit as the central building block in any of these western societies . our society has prospered and developed at an incredible rate by maintaining our core family values . ah yes , if it ain t broke don t fix it . except that now we have homosexuals telling us that it is broke and for good reason . so maybe we should start on fixing it ? honestly , this guy s arguments are full of shit and reeks of intolerance . would not recommend 10 10 , 2 7 with rice .

my response i do not think intentionally childless couple are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples .,"boymoder said my response within my own circle , i do hear a number of sgreans renting public housing , so i do not agree that public housing renters are by and large foreigners this is an opinion , not a factual statement ? how does that prove that most renters are singaporeans ? nevertheless regardless of whether renters are singaporeans or foreigners , you mentioned your main concern is housing prices to finance retirement . but in the first place , housing isnt the primary source to financing retirement . saving , investing and cpf are the three key pillars of retirement for singaporeans . furthermore , singaporeans have low cpf savings and are unable to receive a good payout from cpf life which is the best retirement plan as it is a life long annuity , the root cause of low cpf savings is because singaporeans overspend their oa on property , because housing itself is unaffordable , so shouldnt the government ensure everyone has access to low cost housing bto in non mature estates so they can retire ? wanting to keep property values high is completely contradictory to helping the average singporean especially those who are currently young to retire . to who need it most . should childless couples be able to get 4 room flats and above then ? what if they never procreate ? most likely they will just use one room as their bedroom . proportionating of financial gains subsidized by the govt be part of the consideration , but rather frankly , i think the size is not the issue . since the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . since you think that lgbt singles do not deserve 4 room flats , do you think they should be able to purchase 2 3 room housing which is lesser in space so they can live with a roof over their head ? i would also like to understand more , why do you think childless couples are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples ? my response this statement i don t think is correct . if you look at purely the the cost of construction of the house , well it is cheap . but if you look at the cost of construction , housing is borne by the couples who pay for the flat , im not suggesting anyone receive free housing . the amenities , infrastructure of an estate is not only consumed by one single or one lgbt couple , but rather shared by the entire neighborhood . furthermore regardless of where a person lives , a single or lgbt couple would still consume infrastructure and amenities . furthermore if one does not have access to housing they are more likely to be a burden on the taxpayer through the use of social programs , healthcare etc . i think it is rather easy to see that elevating a person to being a productive member of society by allowing them to be able to afford a roof over their head and being able to contribute to society since they have a stable safety net is much better than them being reliant on handouts when they are stuck in poverty . can you clarify your stance , if singles and lgbt couples do not have housing , what do you think is the solution if not providing btos before 35 even if its just 2 or 3 room flats ? click to expand . . . my response i never say most renters are singaporeans ? i am just rejecting your statement that quote 90 of sgreans live in public housing renters are by and large foreigners . if this is your opinion , that s fine by me . housing instalments are paid by cpf , so housing value indirectly is one of the primary source for retirement . if you are praying for low cost housing bto and resale value , then how are the retirees getting back their cpf money to fund for their retirement ? optimally housing resale price should grow in sync with cpf accrued interest . should childless couples be able to get 4 room flats and above then ? what if they never procreate ? my response i explained myself earlier on this , you can read my post again . frankly , i think the size is not the issue . since the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . since you think that lgbt singles do not deserve 4 room flats , do you think they should be able to purchase 2 3 room housing which is lesser in space so they can live with a roof over their head ? my response i disagree that the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . the size of 4 room is two times that of a 2 room . singles can purchase 2 room housing , which should be more than sufficient for one person . even many retiree couples also stay in a 2 room housing . for a lgbt couple , my suggestion as a work around is to first get a 2 room bto and then get a 3 room in the resale market when reach the age of 35 . it is normal for couples to upgrade their housing over time . i would also like to understand more , why do you think childless couples are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples ? my response i do not think intentionally childless couple are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples . i explained myself earlier on this , you can read my post again .

"whatever benefits the fake news bill brings is amorphous , much like a repeal of 377a ."," i feel that while we can agree that most singaporeans are not single issue voters , you cannot downplay the importance of certain issues in their influence to affect how voters behave . yes , but is there anything to show that 377a truly is one of these issues ? if you take reference abroad , politicians can win elections simply by swaying the voters emotionally , then go on to maintain high level of approval ratings despite not fulfilling election promises . and the pap has long cautioned about taking political lessons from abroad . i am not a fan of the pap , but i actually don t see how political developments abroad are illustrative for what might happen in singapore . we cannot deny that 377a is a very emotionally charged topic that can backfire , especially with people sitting on the fence . i think we can . 377a is an emotionally charged topic , but the extent that it might affect the vote , remains an open question . are you really suggesting that if the pap abolished 377a today , people who have voted for pap for most of their lives would vote for the wp instead ? that 377a would be a more defining issuing during that election than pap s track record , or the wp s alleged problems with their town counsel ? i find that difficult to believe . the thing about casinos is that it generates profits , theres a quantitative data that can show you how it benefits . it is the same for fake news bill , combating illegitimate news sources can prevent slander online the same way as how we banned newspapers that publish irresponsibly . these benefits can be quantified in ways that 377a cannot , thus its is not as motivating to take the risk . 377a has a profit element too , in the form of the pink dollar . moreover , i think that you don t seem to understand the objection to the casino the objections understand that obviously the casino will earn profits , but the objection arises because such profits are earned at the cost of a social ill which is gambling . plus , how exactly is the benefits of the fake news bill quantifiable in the same way as the profits of mbs ? if you can t put a number to it , i think it s a bit of a stretch to call it quantifiable . whatever benefits the fake news bill brings is amorphous , much like a repeal of 377a . or would it be wiser to wait until the political and societal landscape becomes more suitable before you take a stance , else risk losing votes ? but see again we circle back to the assumption that there is a real risk that votes would be lost . however i would like to point out that in our humble beginnings , we tried very hard to promote racial and religious harmony because we understood that our community have very weak social glue in part due to how diverse we are . this culture of avoiding religious conflict could have played a role in their stance against the repeal . you might want to read up a bit more about our humble beginnings . the abortion bill was passed despite massive religious protest . same as the women s charter , which enforced monogamous marriage . the early pap was entirely committed to having a neutral , secular , public space where everyone was regarded as equal , and no one religious view would be given a preferential position . i think that if we still really had that same commitment to racial and religious harmony , 377a should be abolished simply since it would show that no one religion or no two religions , if you include islam holds priority in public affairs . yet we are where we are now , where apparently letters from concerned christians are enough to get metal concerts banned , and the law minister feels comfortable highlighting that these concerts are attended by malay men . racial and religious harmony is a pretty poor explanation for the existence of 377a . edit i think that if you are able to agree with my view that the the government simply isn t as secular as it professes to be , and that many in government want to keep 377a for personal religious reasons , then i am curious as to why you seem to want to also push the view that there is some other practical basis for retaining 377a i . e . the possibility of losing votes . if 377a is being kept for the personal religious reasons of those in government , then whether votes might be lost or not becomes irrelevant , since personal religious reasons do not need to be affirmed by votes .

i find it surprising and perhaps difficult to understand what you mean by the fact that lgbtq folk are not deprived of their rights because according to the law they are .,"i will be addressing the points in your comment , but reorganized into better reading . regarding the change i agree that it s a big jump , if the repeal of 377a directly leads to gay marriage . but it plainly does not do that . furthermore , every small step towards greater acceptance should be welcomed . the law has a great impact in influencing people s behaviour and beliefs . if 377a exists , the message sent is plainly that homosexuals are somehow lesser citizens . lgbt folks are not fully accepted because of both society and the law how does one remove the law from society ? in this regard change can be effected , and not only welcomed when the entirety of society changes itself . even if society is largely conservative , the gap is slowly diminishing . this is a conversation lawmakers must have now before it becomes a much larger issue down the road . the law about being naked in your own home is usually if you are seen . this is similar to my earlier example of sex in public as these fall under public indecency laws . you won t get arrested for bathing , but you will be arrested if you strip in front of your window to the view of the entire hdb . when i say private relations , i mean what you do in absolute private , with no other party involved . as is , 377a outlaws regardless of whether you are seen etc . it is not the same to compare it to the nakedness law . religious and conservative folk try and stop homosexual relations , even though the efficacy of such attempts have widely been debunked by psychological and psychiatric studies . conversion therapy etc has largely been shown to be ineffectual . you seem to separate the section from the people who seek to curb homosexuality , although the creation of the section was indeed to curb homosexuality during the colonial era . i find it surprising and perhaps difficult to understand what you mean by the fact that lgbtq folk are not deprived of their rights because according to the law they are . they plainly cannot marry under the existing law . you too have actually agreed with me you acknowledged that they do not have the full benefits a straight person will enjoy . i m surprised as well to hear that their rights are not infringed upon legally , given that we are having a discussion about the very legal provision that does so . furthermore , the fact that people are arguing to keep the provision demonstrates that lgbt folk have lesser rights than us straight folk what they do in private can be entirely governed and affected by people who are completely unaffected by 377a . i hope that you can see the points i have put forth and where i m coming from .

"sometimes it s based on fluctuating criteria like if 4 out of 5 strangers a trans woman met today addressed her as xiao mei , then she would be better off in the female toilets ."," and as such i think its appropriate that the usual societal norms apply instead of giving transgender people a choice use the toilet corresponding to the sex you are most commonly identified with , not your gender . while i agree on principle , the problem with that framing is that it implies trans people aren t already doing so , and need a law to tell us what is basically common sense as well as a matter of our own safety . so that can come across as patronizing and is one reason for the backlash . it s more or less standard practice for trans people to only switch toilets once they re regularly read as that gender , and to use unisex handicapped toilets or not go at all when in early transition . public toilets are a source of major anxiety and stress for most if not all trans people . so the idea that someone would willingly choose to use a toilet where they stand out more and thus experience more stress is counterintuitive . it s also typically the trans person experiencing the greatest discomfort in those scenarios , whereas i find that a lot of those examples tend to assume that it s everyone else who is uncomfortable while the trans person is totally chill . i thus believe that trans people should have a choice , because figuring out what toilet you should go to is stressful enough without bringing the threat of the law into it . sometimes it s based on fluctuating criteria like if 4 out of 5 strangers a trans woman met today addressed her as xiao mei , then she would be better off in the female toilets . but if she just had a haircut and everyone has been calling her xiao di , then maybe she ll choose to use the male toilets on that day . there s really not much incentive to do otherwise , unless someone wishes to intentionally stand out to make a political statement but that s another matter altogether , and wouldn t apply to most cases . especially when it s singaporeans , who are mostly obedient and afraid of confrontation .

"mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin ."," government considering best way forward on 377a , will respect different viewpoints shanmugam court s decision consistent with past position on 377a mr shanmugam noted that successive court judgments over the years have consistently taken the position that these are highly contentious social issues and within the province of parliament . the heterosexual stable family remains a stable norm , he added . the current legal position reflects our society s norms , values and attitudes . that s what the courts have said . in its judgment , the court noted that the compromise which singapore has struck , in respect to section 377a , is unique , said mr shanmugam . our approach strikes a balance between preserving the legislative status quo , whilst accommodating the concerns of those directly affected by the legislation . the court recognised that the government did this in order to avoid driving a deeper wedge within our society , he added . it also noted that singapore s approach seeks to keep what to do with section 377a within the democratic space . socially charged issues , such as section 377a , call for continued discussion and open ended resolution within the political domain , where we can forge consensus , rather than in win lose outcomes in court . in this way , we can accommodate divergent interests , avoid polarisation and facilitate incremental change , said mr shanmugam . additionally , the court highlighted the importance of creating space for peaceful co existence among various groups , especially since the balance between the various interests around section 377a has grown more delicate . these opinions align with the approach that the government has taken in dealing with section 377a , and that it intends to take as it considers the changes in our social landscape since 2007 . in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong said in parliament , when the penal code was amended but section 377a left unchanged , that we want to be a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society , said mr shanmugam . mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin . this remains our stand today , added mr shanmugam . our emphases on gradual evolution and on traditional families remain constant . shifting attitudes towards homosexuality however , since the issue was last discussed in parliament in 2007 , social attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted , mr shanmugam acknowledged . one of the things that upsets the lgbt community is that many feel that their experience of being hurt or rejected by their families , friends , schools , companies is not recognised , indeed often denied . at the same time , a large majority want to preserve the overall tone of our society , said mr shanmugam . in particular , the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman , and that children should be raised within such a family structure . their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family . many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men . both these viewpoints are valid and important , he added . live and let live approach noting that these are deeply divisive issues , mr shanmugam said that is why the government takes a live and let live approach . we seek to be an inclusive society , where mutual respect and tolerance for different views and practices are paramount . government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement . and agc takes a similar approach . mr shanmugam added that the government had expressly included in the mrha maintenance of religious harmony act that any attack on lgbt groups , or on persons because they are lgbt , will be an offence , and won t be tolerated . lgbt individuals are entitled to live peacefully , without being attacked or threatened , he said . likewise , any attack on any other group , based on their religion , or religious beliefs , even if those beliefs run counter to values held by lgbt groups will not be acceptable . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",03-03-2022 16:08,Reddit,homosexual,1

the first question which trans people are concerned with is not in any way a slippery slope to the second which pedophiles are concerned with .,"thanks ! my team is generally aligned . incidentally , most of us are also christians , myself included . we also skew young i m 30 next year , the youngest two are still in uni and the older members are even less political . of course it s a political movement , though all movements are political . america has many , many , many problems of its own , including the way that many americans are very argumentative and love to sue other people for all sorts of things . whereas singaporeans are stereotypically obedient and conflict avoidant even in cases of injustice when we should be speaking up , so i honestly doubt anything like that would ever happen here . if it did , it would die off pretty quickly . we are not americans . the contrast between pink dot and the average pride march is a good enough indication of that . america s anti discrimination laws were also the product of its racial history with segregation , and how those laws were specifically enacted so that businesses could not discriminate against racial minorities and other marginalised groups . this is not the case in singapore , for better or worse which is why you can see rental ads declaring no indians and such . which is terrible , but i m not sure the law is the best way to deal with that . nonetheless , i do think that this too falls under the umbrella of acceptance . a society where the majority of businesses refuse to serve lgbt people would not be an accepting society at all . while i believe people and business owners should have the right to act according to their conscience , there s also the question of where we draw the line what if a gay man has cancer and hospitals refuse to treat him ? which has happened to at least one trans man , who died as a result . or restaurants refuse to let him eat there , and grocery stores won t sell him food ? at some point i think there need to be policies in place to protect minority groups and ensure they can access the same services that allow them to live and function in society . in the us there s also a distinction between public and private businesses private businesses are allowed to make their own rules regarding who they wish to serve , but public ones which the bakery fell under are not . each is covered by different regulations and thus obligations . i think there s also some provision for refusing service to individuals e . g . the recently freed serial killer who murdered your kids but not to an established protected minority . to advance their own goals what goals would those be ? i ve seen a lot of fear mongering around that , but with no clear motive in place . but then how would you know it is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all ? . . . somehow you are a ok with them knowing what gender they are . dont you find that very paradoxical ? because the two have nothing at all to do with each other . it is entirely appropriate to ask a four year old are you a boy or a girl ? people do that all the time . but it is entirely inappropriate to ask that same four year old would you want to have sex with me ? the first question which trans people are concerned with is not in any way a slippery slope to the second which pedophiles are concerned with . i dont think it is a good idea to pump young children full of hormone and other drugs i agree , but transgender children are not given any medical treatment until puberty . such treatment is unnecessary at that point . transition in their case is just social , and on a case by case basis depending on what that particular child needs . most clinics that treat trans children operate on a harm reduction basis e . g . if a kid is crying every day because they want shorter hair , they can start by getting the kid a haircut and seeing if that helps . if that s enough , it can stop there . if not , they can continue slowly taking things step by step , constantly monitoring how the child responds , all the way to full social transition if necessary . at puberty , if the child still fulfils the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and expresses clinically significant distress over the physical changes of puberty , they may be assessed as suitable candidates for hormone blockers , which not all trans youth may choose to have . these have been used safely for decades in children with precocious puberty , which is arguably what most children go through nowadays a century ago , children didn t hit puberty until their mid teens or later , so delaying puberty might even be beneficial . while there may still be mild side effects , the benefits in this case far outweigh any consequences . here s one long term study http pediatrics . aappublications . org content early 2014 09 02 peds . 2013 2958 . abstract of 55 trans youths who underwent hormone blockers at puberty followed by hormone replacement therapy several years later . the results after 7 years were overwhelmingly positive , where the youths scored equal or better than their non trans peers on various mental health assessments . there were 0 suicides . this is particularly striking given that trans youth who don t undergo this treatment have always scored very badly on mental health assessments , with almost half attempting suicide . this other study http pediatrics . aappublications . org content early 2016 02 24 peds . 2015 3223 involved prepubescent transgender children who had socially not medically transitioned , with similarly positive results developmentally normal rates of depression and anxiety , vs . the highly elevated rates normally observed in transgender children who are unable to socially transition . so what we know right now is that enabling transition for trans youth is effective , and has been the first approach in history that has not just reduced but normalised the high rates of depression , anxiety and suicidal attempts typically associated with the trans community . that s why trans activists are striving to make this more accessible . i was a trans kid once , and if transition had been an option for me it would have saved me years of unnecessary psychological distress and resulting therapy , plus one suicide attempt , and i hope for a day when no more trans children have to go through what i and many of my friends did .

action for aids singapore , free community church , pink dot sg , young out here , project x , and oogachaga , among others . the demise of section 377a represents something different to each individual , the statement pointed out . for some who have experienced bullying , rejection and harassment enabled by the law , repeal would enable the beginning of a process of healing . for others , however , repeal would have arrived far too late . for those that long for a more equal and inclusive singapore , repeal signifies that change is indeed possible . and for our friends and family who have stood by us , repeal is proof and encouragement that your allyship makes a difference , it said . to the past victims of section 377a and its cascading effects , including those who have faced threats of police entrapment , raids and criminal charges , repeal will never be able to fully right the historic wrongs that you faced . to others whom we have lost along the way , we have not forgotten the heavy toll that this law has exacted on you and your loved ones . the statement also acknowledged the generations of activists , community groups and allies . their advocacy often came at great personal cost but paved the way for policy and societal change , as well as kept hope alive for many . the statement from the lgbtq groups suggested that the government s intention to repeal section 377a is only the start . it noted the immediate priorities would be to tackle the areas of discrimination at home , in schools and in workplaces , as well as in housing and healthcare systems . the true impact of repeal will be determined by how the people of singapore respond to it , and treat each other , in the days and months to come . it must be accompanied by the rejection of hate , of stigma , of discrimination , of erasure . it must be the beginning of us finding common ground and having open conversations about our collective futures , it said . we cannot allow this to polarise us , deepen fissures , or make an already vulnerable community more susceptible to contempt . we must , in the face of potential backlash , strengthen ties within our community and look out for one another . echoing similar sentiments , indignation told cna separately that public discourse is likely to become more heated and toxic as singapore heads towards a repeal . we wish to remind the members of our community that you are not alone in these trying times . our community has a long history of weathering hostility . look out for one another . practice care and compassion , both for yourself and your fellow queers . reach out to your local queer organisations if you need to , it said . reminding the lgbtq community to engage in meaningful discussions with those who matter , mr choong and mr leow from oogachaga reiterated that these discussions should be done in a safe and respectful manner , with facts and evidence , not opinions and misinformation . the statement from the lgbtq groups added that the repeal would be a hard won victory and a triumph of love over fear . as we celebrate this historical milestone , we urge the community , and indeed all singaporeans , to continue to imagine and work toward a better future for all , it said . a society without section 377a is a society that is more progressive , not just for lgbtq people , but for everyone . no one is free until everyone is free . this is a win for humanity . when section 377a is repealed , it will not only improve the lives of lgbtq singaporeans and their families , it will also bring other benefits to business , trade , and boost our international reputation as a progressive , developed economy , added oogachaga s mr choong and mr leow . meanwhile , action for aids afa singapore

court appeal pits laws on discrimination against religious freedom washington the us supreme court has agreed to hear an appeal from a colorado baker with religious objections to same sex marriage who had lost a discrimination case for refusing to create a cake to celebrate such a union . the case will be a major test of a clash between laws that ban businesses open to the public from discriminating based on sexual orientation and claims of religious freedom . across the united states , businesses such as bakeries , florists and photography studios have said , so far with little success , that forcing them to serve gay couples violates their constitutional rights . the supreme court s decision , expected next year , will again take the justices into a heated battle in the culture wars . on one side are gay and lesbian couples who say they are entitled to equal treatment from businesses that choose to serve the general public . on the other are religious people and companies who say the government should not force them to choose between the requirements of their faiths and their livelihoods . in a series of decisions culminating in its 2015 ruling establishing a constitutional right to same sex marriage , the supreme court has consistently ruled in favour of gay rights . but it has also said that businesses run on religious principles may sometimes be exempted from generally applicable laws , as when it ruled in 2014 that some companies could not be required to provide free contraceptive coverage for their female workers . the new case , masterpiece cakeshop v colorado civil rights commission , no . 16 111 , started in 2012 , when baker jack phillips , an owner of masterpiece cakeshop in lakewood , colorado , refused to create a cake for the wedding reception of mr david mullins and mr charlie craig , who were planning to marry in massachusetts . the couple filed discrimination charges , and they won before a civil rights commission and in the courts . the case will be a major test of a clash between laws that ban businesses open to the public from discriminating based on sexual orientation and claims of religious freedom . this has always been about more than a cake , mr mullins said . businesses should not be allowed to violate the law and discriminate against us because of who we are and who we love . however , mr phillips , who calls himself a cake artist , argued that two parts of the first amendment its protections for free expression and religious freedom overrode a colorado anti discrimination law and allowed him to refuse to create a custom wedding cake . mr david cortman , one of mr phillips lawyers , said the case concerned fundamental rights . every american should be free to choose which art they will create and which art they won t create without fear of being unjustly punished by the government , he said . in 2015 , a colorado appeals court ruled against mr phillips . masterpiece does not convey a message supporting same sex marriages merely by abiding by the law and serving its customers equally , the court said . in a supreme court brief , lawyers for mr phillips said he is happy to create other items for gay and lesbian clients . but his faith requires him , they said , to use his artistic talents to promote only messages that align with his religious beliefs . thus , the brief said , he declines lucrative business by not creating goods that contain alcohol or cakes celebrating halloween and other messages his faith prohibits , such as racism , atheism , and any marriage not between one man and one woman . the brief also said mr mullins and mr craig could have bought a cake from another baker and , in fact , easily obtained a free wedding cake with a rainbow design from another bakery . in response , the couple s lawyer wrote that it is no answer to say that mullins and craig could shop somewhere else for their wedding cake , just as it was no answer in 1966 to say that african american customers could eat at another restaurant . nytimes a version of this article appeared in the print edition of the straits times on june 28 , 2017 , with

"even then , social traits like homosexuality would not be heavily selected against as kinship ties are still highly important in the modern state .","it is highly unlikely for homosexuals to be selected against in an evolutionary sense . we have to take into account the fact that the modern state is a very recent concept , and that kinship ties and sexual selection still play important roles in sexual reproduction under the modern state . evolution occurs over a very very long span of time . if you take a pre historic human thousands and thousands of years ago and compare him her to a modern human , both of them would be biologically indistinguishable . the whole of human history is but a blip in the evolutionary timeline . the concept of a modern state , is as the name suggests , modern and thus would have had a negligible effect on human evolution so far . only if the structure of a modern state persists for tens of thousands of years can we perhaps start seeing an evolutionary change in human populations whereby anti social traits are able to persist since they are not as heavily selected against as they would before . even then , social traits like homosexuality would not be heavily selected against as kinship ties are still highly important in the modern state . we still organize ourselves into extended family groups and occasionally look to relatives for support when things get tough . in addition , as i pointed out in my earlier post , homosexuality may also confer benefits to heterosexual reproduction . if a particular trait has a strong effect on making women more sexually attractive , while a weak effect in making men homosexual , selection pressures will then allow these homosexual traits to persist in populations as they benefit heterosexual reproduction with only a minor evolutionary drawback in the rare homosexual cases . of course , vice versa can happen . read the bbc article linked in my previous post . ultimately , this means that as long as sexual reproduction in humans occurs , homosexuality can still persist as it benefits the overall population . and i think we can agree on the fact that sexual reproduction is definitely still around in the era of the modern state . in conclusion , homosexuality still plays a part in the modern state , whether by conferring kinship or sexual reproductive benefits . this , of course , presupposes the fact that the modern state will continue to be structurally present for tens of thousands of years such that it has an impact on evolution which is not highly likely . the only way for homosexuality to be considered evolutionary non advantageous would be in a dystopian modern state where the government decides who you have sex and raise a child with no sexual attractiveness factor in reproduction and each nuclear family is governmentally forbidden from ever knowing or interacting with their extended family no kinship factor . and this government must persist for many many millennia . i think one option is likelier than the other .

 i am a catholic and my church calls homosexual intercourse and marriage a sin .," i am a catholic and my church calls homosexual intercourse and marriage a sin . evil . wrongdoing . somethng people should be saved from . all sin is something we should be saved from , including heterosexual lust , greed , murder . . . and only christ can do that . the so called official position is that we can accept lgbt people for who they are and they can accept themselves for who they are but them acting on their desires to love or to be the gender they feel they are is wrong . we accept drug addicts as christians , but for them to indulge in drugs that harm their bodies is wrong . in lieu of christ s teachings , i don t see anything inherently wrong here . and yet , when people say and repeat these words without thinking , they do not stop to think that our religion was founded on the words of christ , that god is love , that to be called to love others and love ourselves is our first commandment . that the first people jesus brought his message to were those persecuted and unfairly hated in society . the ones that the religious authorities of that time hated and feared and despised . loving people coddling them and giving them good feels . i understand that pharisees are not exactly the right way of doing it , but christ did not exactly mince his words when it comes to sin and salvation . it is impossible to tell someone to accept themselves and that they accept them too while calling them sinners just because god made them that way . god isn t responsible for a sinful lifestyle , we are . by that logic i should go out and murder all my tech support clients and have sex everywhere because that s who i am ! . so in my opinion , you have done no wrong just by being bisexual . bring good ultimately isn t about whether you follow the teachings religiously . its about whether at the end of the day you can look back at the things you have done and can answer the question of whether you have treated your fellow human beings well in your time on earth honestly and truthfully . who is good except god alone ? in light of that , what then is goodness that we may follow ? and in how you do not hate them in return for their actions and words , your firm belief in morality and acceptance of yourself for who you are , you embody christian virtue far better than these fools who cannot see past their own pride and fear . swing both ways in the extreme , and both are wrong .

"adherents of monotheistic faiths are less likely to support lgbt rights , and may want state involvement in the form of retaining section 377a or curtailing the rise of lgbt discourse and events such as the annual pro lgbt pink dot rally , the study said ."," majority of singaporeans uncomfortable with religious leaders speaking up on lgbt issues ips study singapore religious people or leaders speaking up strongly on lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt issues could cause significant discomfort among singaporeans . some six in 10 respondents to a study of public opinion on faultlines in singapore said they would be uncomfortable with this scenario . the respondents also identified religion and lgbt issues as the faultlines most likely to lead to the polarisation of society . these findings , which were released by the institute of policy studies on tuesday oct 29 , attest to the importance of the government s policy of separating religion and politics , said the study s authors . it also highlights the need for consultative and inclusive policy making to mitigate polarisation , they added . the authors were ips senior research fellow mathew mathews , research associate melvin tay and research assisant shanthini selvarajan . between 2013 and 2018 , there have been steep drops in opposition towards lgbt issues , the study said . but divisions along this faultline are likely to deepen , given the role that other social divides such as religion , age and education level play in shaping attitudes towards lgbt issues . christian respondents were the most likely to be amenable to religious leaders being vocal about lgbt issues . slightly over half of them said they would be comfortable with it , while the majority of those professing other religions or no religion between 55 to 71 per cent said they would feel uncomfortable . older and less educated respondents were also more likely to indicate discomfort with religious leaders engaging in public discourse on lgbt issues . this could be due to younger and more educated respondents being more inclined towards free speech , the study said . on the potential consequences of managing lgbt issues poorly , younger and more educated respondents were more likely to feel this could result in polarisation , anger against particular communities and falling levels of trust in the government . half of those aged 18 to 25 , the youngest cohort surveyed , said polarisation and anger were likely consequences , as did more than half of respondents who held a bachelor s degree and above . just over a third of those aged above 65 , and those with secondary education and below , felt the same way . about 27 per cent of the youngest respondents and 28 per cent of degree holders felt that erosion of trust in the government was likely compared to less than 18 per cent for both the oldest and least educated respondents . this could indicate that lgbt issues were seen as more crucial among younger and more educated respondents , who tended to be more accepting of lgbt rights , the study said . christian respondents , who were more likely to hold conservative views on gender and sexuality , also indicated the highest levels of concern over all of the potential consequences compared to those of other religious affiliations . this illustrates the significance of lgbt issues to christians in relation to their faith , the study said . the divisiveness of lgbt issues also came through in respondents desired levels of state involvement and public discussion . younger respondents and those who said they held more liberal views on sexuality were the most likely to want greater government involvement and more public discussion of lgbt issues . the potential reasons for them wanting more government involvement could be in the form of ensuring equal rights for lgbt people or repealing section 377a , said dr mathews . section 377a of the penal code criminalises consensual sex between men , an offence which carries up to a two year jail term . older respondents and those who said they held neutral or more conservative views on sexuality were more likely to feel the current levels of government involvement and public discussion are sufficient . christians 46 per cent and muslims about 44 per cent were also more likely to support greater government involvement but for different reasons . adherents of monotheistic faiths are less likely to support lgbt rights , and may want state involvement in the form of retaining section 377a or curtailing the rise of lgbt discourse and events such as the annual pro lgbt pink dot rally , the study said . they may want government involvement to deal with what might be seen as intrusions on the status quo , said dr mathews . but a sizeable proportion of muslims also indicated that they wanted less government involvement 21 per cent of muslims fell into this category , compared to just 12 . 6 per cent of christians and 18 . 1 per cent of respondents overall . this implies that within the muslim community , there are significant differences in views on whether lgbt issues should fall within the ambit of governance and

"socially , even if we have a larger proportion of people polled to be against gay marriage , the overt rejection of it is arguably lesser .","i think there are a few factors to talk about . legally , it s true that it s harder to live as an lgbtq here , mostly due to the lack of a recognition of marriage between them . socially , even if we have a larger proportion of people polled to be against gay marriage , the overt rejection of it is arguably lesser . subtle rejection like whispering behind the back and disapproving stares may be prevalent , but most singaporeans are not as socially forward as people in the west . the people against lgbtq in the us will be more upfront and blatant , sometimes even violent . i doubt any lgbtq people here actually fear for their lives here , while it might not necessarily be true there in the us depending on state and town you re in . for sure it still sucks to be lgbtq here and we can do better , but the worst ? probably too hyperbolic .

net publication 51768297 treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria in the netherlands .," first of all , look at my other comment . your claim that studies suggest that a very small percentage of people retransition is blatantly false . the number of children who desist their gender dysphoria before age 29 is alarmingly high . i looked at the article you posted in the other comment i couldn t find your 2008 article , it looks like you posted the 2013 steensma article twice . he used the dsm iv definition that is considered outdated that did not require a child consistently state that they are a different gender than that assigned at birth there s an infographic of the changes in this article https thinkprogress . org transgender children desistance a5caf61fc5c6 wrt . dsm 5 . if you include kids who are gender non conforming but don t have a different gender identity , it s likely going to inflate the any desistance numbers . he also included both children without any developed secondary sex characteristics and adolescents who do have some characteristics and are more certain if they want them . from steensma 2011 https sci hub . do https pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov 21216800 the actual physical changes during puberty usually resulted in hatred of and disgust with their bodies . . . as a result of the increased aversion towards their bodies , the girls became insecure with themselves . . . especially the actual physical changes made both boys and girls feel obstructed in their lives , and resulted in a strong desire for medical treatment e . g . , puberty blocking hormones , cross sex hormones , and surgery . this is me editorializing , but the 2013 steensma study wanted to include both trans kids and kids likely to be mistaken for trans kids . he deliberately included sub threshold gd kids and included two questionnaires that had high sensitivity and specificity in that sample adolescents reports of gd and body image were compared across persisters and desisters , and showed that persisters reported more gd than desisters in the mean total scores of both the giiaa and the ugds . clinically , for the giiaa , scores of less than 3 indicate gd 87 . 2 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 0 of the desisters . for the ugds , scores of more than 40 . 0 indicate gd 97 . 9 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 2 . 2 of the desisters 1 bisexual , natal girl . if he was just looking for trans people , he might as well just have stuck with the ugds . he clarifies in this interview https www . kqed . org futureofyou 441784 the controversial research on desistance in transgender youth that the purpose of the study was to find variables that could act as predictors of persistence , not whether currently existing tools can identify trans kids , so it would make sense that he d want both persisters and desisters in his original sample . we re talking about sexual maturity that only triggers on the onset of puberty . we re not , we re talking about gender identity , that the blaunchedcauli correctly said that as far as we know starts being expressed by about age 3 . it is undeniable that puberty causes an immense change in our psychology . to stop a child s psychological development for the sake of a political agenda is child abuse . that s not stopping the development of psychology for the sake of a political agenda . if you think that either testosterone or estrogen are necessary for psychological development then we should be administering that earlier , not later . i ve not seen any negative studies on kids starting puberty at 16 the age of medical consent in the uk and some us states as opposed younger endogenous puberty timings . it s also for the sake of preventing the development of secondary sex characteristics the kids don t want , idk what the political agenda is . 2 . there are medically advised age limits for medications for children with such disorders . . . they re an estimate to do the greatest good . okay so it kind of just looks like you re unaware of what current standards of care for trans kids are . this is based on what i understand to be the current standards of care known as the dutch protocol https www . researchgate . net publication 51768297 treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria in the netherlands . the adolescent should have reached tanner stage 2 to 3 and be older than 12 years of age . starting around tanner stages 2 to 3 , the very rst physical changes are still reversible . some experience with one s physical puberty is required because the authors assume that experiencing one s own puberty is diagnostically useful . it is at the onset of puberty that it becomes clear whether the gender dysphoria will desist or persist puberty blockers pb are only administered after a child has already undergone some pubertal changes , and even then they only delay puberty , where stopping pbs continue endogenous puberty . cross sex hormones are generally only administered at 16 again the medical age of consent in some major countries . we don t have to resort to hypothetical trans kids making a heavy decision , we already have empirical data on whether kids can make this decision in conjunction with a team of doctors and their parents . there are more studies on trans youth than these , but two i m aware of are this dutch study https sci hub . do https www . jsm . jsexmed . org article s1743 6095 18 30057 2 fulltext sec3 . 3 that looked at kids from 1972 2015 and found that only 1 . 9 decided to stop puberty blockers after starting though if i remember correctly they have no figures on anyone who wanted to transition again later and this retrospective study https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc7073269 that found higher suicidal ideation in those who wanted but could not get pb than those that managed to get pb . 3 . . . . why the fuck are we green lighting a condition that is even less well understood especially in the long term and fraught with political motivations ? see , i do not get what political motivations means . my first instinct is to be glib and say the imh assuming the

"trans women who transitioned young and never went through male puberty do not have any advantage , and actually have a small disadvantage because they do not produce testosterone .","on the professional level , trans women have to meet strict criteria in order to participate , such as 1 2 years on monitored hrt . this drastically reduces their athletic performance and brings it close to or on par with other women . then it also depends on the sport and at what age and how they transitioned . they may retain small advantages in some sports but have disadvantages in others . where advantages exist , after hrt , they fall within the same range as other physical advantages that athletes may naturally have . e . g . being a tall basketball player is not illegal , even though they have a big physical advantage over short players . hrt for trans women also greatly reduces their muscle mass and strength , but their bones don t change , so they may have weaker muscles moving heavier bones that are a disadvantage in some sports but could be beneficial in others . things like flexibility , agility , endurance and so on are also factors they may perform better or worse at . it s why the official olympic guidelines are that each sport should have its own criteria . trans women who transitioned young and never went through male puberty do not have any advantage , and actually have a small disadvantage because they do not produce testosterone . most professional athletes are young . so over time , more and more trans female athletes will fall into this category , and there would not be a reason to ban them from competing . lastly , it s extremely rare for trans women to succeed in athletics partly because it s traditionally seen as masculine , and also because being good enough to compete professionally requires a lot of time , money , coaching and strong social support , which trans people are much less likely to have . that in itself is a huge disadvantage . the stats say a lot trans people have been eligible to compete in the olympics since 2003 . since then , only 2 trans women have qualified , one as a reserve , out of a total of 63 , 000 olympians . the problem is that those rare people get featured in sensational media articles to the point that people think it s an epidemic , and misses how they really beat incredible odds to even get to that point .

how do we ensure 377a will be the end of lgbtq demands ?,"lala24 said so your point is there is a moral angle to the issue . ie pedos is morally wrong . morals are not rights . we consider it morally wrong to murder a human being but not animals or trees . we consider it morally wrong to commit adultery hence there are laws punishable for this . we consider it morally wrong to commit incest and etc . then your issue is that you consider it morally wrong for same sex to have a relationship . while is is debatable by societies at large , i wouldnt go so far to say if this is morally right or wrong . some echelons of societies have made up their minds whether this is right or wrong even then , this has no bearing on a citizens rights to housing , education , and etc click to expand . . . i think you are confused with my entire point . i m saying this 377a is the start of a massive slippery slope that will impact ordinary singaporeans . how do we ensure 377a will be the end of lgbtq demands ? these are very practical aspects of everyday life once the slippery slope starts . bto prices will be affected young couples who want to start a family will have to pay much more and wait much longer . this will result in an lower tfr . on the education side , curriculum might be changed to bend over to lgbt demands to normalize lgbtq ideologies and incorporate them to young minds . this is dangerous as kids are easily influenced . and these are just 2 examples of the ministries that will immediately be affected once the slippery slope happens . if it stops at just repealing 377a , then the govt would have repealed it decades ago . i do not agree with allowing this slippery slope to happen . it has nothing to do with what you have replied in any of my comments so far .

"re walt heyer he previously said so in his own words that he was not actually trans , and used to frame his story as a case of medical malpractice and misdiagnosis .","it helps to look into why those adults regretted it , though . for example , misdiagnosis is more common for adults because they undergo much more lenient assessment often a one off diagnosis by one or two psychs , vs children who need to be assessed by a whole team of doctors and psychiatrists before social transition , are monitored throughout , and then have to go for another round of assessments before beginning puberty blockers , with continued monitoring . this provides more failsafes than it does for adults , who could just find a less rigorous doctor willing to approve them for treatment if they pay enough money . there s also how many of those adults transitioned a decade or more ago , when both doctors and patients were much less informed on trans issues and more prone to making misdiagnoses . regarding regret in particular , many reasons cited often had to do with dissatisfactory surgical results or health complications which thus concerned surgery and not transition in general , which have significantly improved over the years since the 1960s when those first patients were tracked , or from not being able to visually blend in with other people of their gender , which is a complete non issue for those who transition at puberty . another large source of regret was the abuse they received from family , friends and society after transition , such as being fired from their jobs and kicked out of their homes and made to resort to sex work to survive the regret thus came from deciding they would have rather tolerated living with dysphoria than have to live life that way . almost all of these problems do not exist for those who transition at puberty , who by necessity have supportive family , and who never develop the secondary sexual characteristics that would otherwise require additional surgery or make it difficult for them to look like others in their gender . more than that , as a society we do already trust children and young teenagers to know their gender . if we didn t , we would be mandating puberty blockers for everyone in case they turned out to be transgender and deeply regret going through the wrong puberty . statistically , the vast majority of children are not likely to be trans , which is why we don t but likewise , a child who fulfills the diagnostic criteria and has passed multiple assessments is statistically very likely to be trans , and treatment thus errs on the side of caution . re walt heyer he previously said so in his own words that he was not actually trans , and used to frame his story as a case of medical malpractice and misdiagnosis . that framing has since changed to present himself as a trans person who regretted transition .

just like how most singaporeans are against lesbians even though female homosexuality is also legal here .,"longer reply because you deserve a proper response , and i don t believe in silencing concerns . the thing is that you re conflating several issues laws around who can enter toilets , laws around trans people changing their legal sex , laws against sexual crimes , and social attitudes towards trans people . firstly , singapore has no law preventing people from entering and using toilets that do not match their legal sex . it is and has always been legal for trans people or anyone else to use the public toilets of their choice . individual institutions like schools may have different laws , but not singapore as a whole . so the claim that making it legal to do so would lead to an onrush of cross dressing sexual predators isn t supported by the reality that it is already legal to do so , and we re not seeing this happen . john is a sexual predator in country y , where it is legal for him to use a female toilet even though his i . c is male . nobody pays attention to him because hey who knows , she is a transgender . not nice calling people out . i m curious about why you think removing laws around gendered toilet use would equate to social acceptance of trans people . singapore does not have those laws i . e . we are already country y , nor any trans equivalent of 377a , and yet society is still strongly anti trans . just like how most singaporeans are against lesbians even though female homosexuality is also legal here . john is born a male , transition to female and changed her ic to female . she name herself jane . she still look masculine . jane enters the female toilet . some karen decide that she is a sexual predator . police came , checked that she is a female . everyone goes home . the end . happily ever after . but what if jane was rushing to school , or work , or had an emergency family situation at home ? there s also the stress of causing a scene and people staring while she s detained outside the toilet waiting for police to come . what if this happens every time she goes to pee ? note she is legally female in this scenario , so won t be allowed to use the male toilets instead . or what if jane was in fact trans and legally female , but also a sexual predator ? or what if she was a regular non trans legally female woman and a sexual predator ? the opposite could happen too . what if john from the earlier scenario was an actual guy who was in the female toilet for innocent reasons like if he was about to vomit and couldn t make it to the male toilet in time , or if he s intellectually disabled and made a mistake , or his mother screamed for help and he rushed in ? i m sure you can think of other scenarios . i don t think any of those should warrant calling the police , even though it s also possible that someone could use those excuses to peep on women . and it would be much easier and less conspicuous than dressing up . someone s gender should not be the focus when it comes to deciding whether a crime has been committed . asking is this person really trans , or only pretending to be ? is the wrong question . the right question would be did this person commit a sexual crime ? and if the answer is yes , it doesn t matter if this is a woman , man , genderfluid person , mp , your ah ma , or anyone else . it would still be wrong and still be a crime .

do have empathy for the homosexual christians who have to struggle to reconcile their sinful urges with the religion they follow .,"i don t think that s the message that they are preaching . the gospel they believe in isn t you re gay and you ll go to hell . homosexuality is a sin , as is lying , theft , sexual promiscuity , murder , etc . but sinners don t go to hell , not if they accept jesus as christ . but being a christian doesn t mean you immediately stop sinning , forever . ask any christian the struggle with sin is a constant battle in life . at the end of the day i don t think this message is for non christian homosexuals , or i want to believe the intention isn t and it may have been corrupted . i want to believe this is for the christian homosexuals , those who believe in christ and are struggling with sin . rather than condemn them , which would then turn them away from church , possibly god , and thus actually condemn them to hell , this stance focuses on saving the sinner , on welcoming them and keeping them in the church , and helping them with their struggle with sin . obviously if you re a homosexual non christian , this will sound like nonsense . but then that s because you re not the intended audience . so if you say many people prefer the fire and brimstone , then these people probably aren t christian . do have empathy for the homosexual christians who have to struggle to reconcile their sinful urges with the religion they follow . these are targets of the message of acceptance . so yes , they re not supportive of homosexuality , but they are supportive of the homosexual christians .

find me a result on google with the search terms catholic sex abuse that has the word homsexual in it and compare it to the number of articles that don t . if you re going to attack the catholic church , at least get your facts right . the john jay university report remember , commissioned by a catholic institution , stated that 81 percent of the victims in the cases were male . by contrast , victims of child sexual assault are mostly female see david finkelhor s study on this matter . so even though the crux of the matter is pedophilic abuse , don t try to pretend homosexual abuse wasn t a part of the matter as well it absolutely was , considering more than 80 of the victims were male . oh boy , you ve just opened a can of worms and royally screwed yourself over . good luck recovering from this . you ve just associated homosexuality with pedophilia and admitted to being anti lgbt . while it is true that more victims are males , studies have shown that a male pedophile molesting a male victim doesn t mean the offender is homosexual https 1in6 . org get information myths point 4 , a fact exemplified by the lack of the word homosexual in almost every single report regarding the abuse cases . another article to validate the point i am making https www . zeroabuseproject . org victim assistance jwrc keep kids safe sexual offenders 101 sexuality of offenders . infact , the term pedophilia has been so associated when the topic of sexual abuse is brought up , that according to this article https en . m . wikipedia . org wiki debate on the causes of clerical child abuse , the holy see stated that the majority of catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under 18 year olds should not be viewed as pedophiles , but as homosexuals . proving my point that pedophilia is the dominant term associated with the sex abuse cases and not homosexuality . the same article says that the move angered many gay rights organizations and sex abuse victims groups , who claimed it was an attempt by the vatican to redefine the church s past problems with pedophilia as problems with homosexuality . , and you are precisely doing this by trying to associate the problems of sex abuse within the church with homosexuality . so stop pretending that it is a homosexual problem when it isn t , or are you really also anti lgbt ? here s a other quote from the article margaret smith , a john jay college criminologist who worked on the report , pointed out that it is an unwarranted conclusion to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay . though the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature . . . participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man . she further stated that the idea of sexual identity should be separated from the problem of sexual abuse . . . . a t this point , we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now . 21 studies aside , virtually none of the articles regarding the church s scandals even contain the word homosexual . in retrospect , this was because the media reports were purposely trying to avoid associating the lgbt community with the scandals . at the very least , you are defending someone who is knowingly or unknowingly making an anti lgbt statement and i suggest you reconsider the point you are trying to make . are you seriously going to associate homosexuality with pedophilia , despite the scientific proof that they are absolutely exclusive ? be very careful about your reply , because you could be perpetuating the lie that homosexuality is associated with pedophilia , something you , and the person you are defending , have been doing in your previous replies . as for your second main point , i already showed you how to find the original comment . the commenter was trying to disprove the original posters claim that back then , man didn t need to beware other man , by giving an example of how back then , man did need to beware of other man because homosexual assault isn t new finding the original comment doesn t matter now as i have already shown , with quotes , how you ve responded in defence of why would a guy want to look at another guy when he has the same body parts in two different posts . next time you decide to defend a cheap shot against the catholic church , i suggest you get your facts right and think carefully about whether or not you want to dig a hole you can t climb out of . your options now are literally to admit you were wrong in defending the association of homosexuality with pedophilia , proving my point that the church has absolutely nothing to do with the topic , or continue to defend and perpetuate a scientifically proven anti lgbt lie that the gay rights community is upset about .

" former chief justice chan sek keong calls for review of section 377a , says law is outdated singapore former chief justice chan sek keong has called for the constitutional validity of section 377a , which criminalises sexual acts between men , to be reviewed ."," former chief justice chan sek keong calls for review of section 377a , says law is outdated singapore former chief justice chan sek keong has called for the constitutional validity of section 377a , which criminalises sexual acts between men , to be reviewed . he made the call in a paper titled equal justice under the constitution and section 377a of the penal code which was published online by the singapore academy of law journal on monday oct 14 . advertisement advertisement in his paper , mr chan notes that section 377a criminalises acts of gross indecency between males , whether homosexual or bisexual , but not similar acts between males and females , or between females . he asked whether such unequal treatment violated the fundamental rights of all to equality before the law and equal protection under the law , as provided for under article 12 1 of the constitution . laws differentiating based on sex or gender must have a rational basis , he said , giving the example of parliament hypothetically passing a law against women smoking cigars . if parliament bans women , but not men , from smoking cigars , equality of all persons under article 12 1 requires the state to justify the reasonableness of the ban , said mr chan . advertisement advertisement this could be done on health grounds , if medical research showed women were more prone to lung cancer than men , for example . however , if this were based on parliament finding women smoking cigars undignified or unseemly , the courts would have to consider whether such a reason was legitimate , he argued . citing the case of lim meng suang who launched a legal bid against the constitutionality of section 377a in 2013 mr chan noted the judge at the time had upheld the law on the grounds that its purpose was to criminalise male homosexual conduct , as such behaviour was not acceptable or desirable here . however , the former chief justice noted that section 377a was in fact enacted in 1938 to strengthen laws against male prostitution , which was rife according to crime reports at the time and posed serious problems to law and order , public morality and wholesome government . section 377a was enacted for this purpose , and not because male homosexuality per se was unacceptable in singapore society , he said . the law , he argued , was a product of specific social conditions that have long ceased to exist here . mr chan described section 377a as an outlier in singapore s criminal law regime , and the only genuine gender specific offence in our criminal laws . government sees no legitimate state purpose in enforcement while section 377 under which carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animals was an offence was repealed in 2007 under amendments to the penal code , section 377a was retained . the decision not to repeal was based on the misapprehension that the section covered penetrative sex , a hallmark of male homosexuality , he said . parliament reaffirmed the wrong purpose , he added . furthermore , the decision not to repeal section 377a did not affirm its purpose , said mr chan . he noted mps at the time were not asked to vote on it as the government had already decided well before the parliamentary sitting that it would not repeal section 377a , but at the same time not enforce it . the decision not to enforce section 377a with respect to consensual male penetrative sex in private can be seen as a repudiation of its legitimacy , he said , adding it implies the government sees no legitimate state purpose in criminalising or prosecuting male homosexual conduct . the 1938 purpose became invalid in the eyes of the government in 2007 , he stated . the court must interpret section 377a in a way that does not violate the constitution , which depends on the nature of its inconsistency with article 12 1 , said mr chan . if the original purpose of section 377a no longer exists , it can be construed to conform to the constitution by reading it as a gender neutral provision that criminalises non penetrative sex of gross indecency committed in public , he added . court challenges to 377a to be heard in november the views of mr chan , who served as attorney general ag between 1992 and 2006 together with those of other former ags such as v k rajah and walter woon , as well as current deputy ag hri kumar nair are being cited by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt rights activist roy tan , who filed a challenge against the constitutionality of section 377a in court in september . dr tan , a retired general practitioner who helped organise the first pink dot event in 2009 , is one of three people who have filed court challenges against section 377a since last year . the other two are disc jockey mr johnson ong ming and mr bryan choong , former executive director of lgbt non profit organisation oogachaga . all three cases will be

"legislation the panellists also touched on the question of whether lgbtq individuals can be equals in singapore without legislative changes , such as the repeal of section 377a of the penal code that

people are tolerant of friends or co workers in same sex relationships , they apply other values such as their moral views on family a gay panellist who helms a podcast said that there needs to be accurate representation of lgbtq individuals in the media it is not possible for everyone to come to a consensus on lgbtq issues , but there must be a willingness to talk , he added singapore young singaporeans are less accepting of family members having same sex relationships than they are of their friends and colleagues as they apply different values on both groups . while they apply tolerance on their co workers , other values such as their notions of morality or the traditional family unit come into play when dealing with a family member . researcher mathew mathews , who was speaking during a today live webinar on friday nov 19 , said so in my family setting , i would want that value to operate . i need people to live within a certain kind of boundary . dr mathews , who heads the social lab at the national university of singapore s institute of policy studies , was commenting on the findings of the today youth survey 2021 . the survey , which polled 1 , 066 respondents between the ages of 18 and 35 in early october , found that more than 70 per cent of respondents were willing to accept friends or work alongside those having same sex relationships , but 58 per cent were willing to accept family members who do so . relating his personal experience , another panellist on the webinar , mr yeo sam jo , said that the difference in attitudes towards friends or family members who are homosexual could also stem from a place of concern . mr yeo , who helms the sg boys podcast that discusses gay issues , said that when he finally told his parents last year that he was gay , his mother expressed concern over whether he would face discrimination at work or be treated differently by people due to his sexual orientation . i can t speak for why there is a discrepancy in the survey results as a whole but if you go by a case by case basis , i think a lot of it really boils down to the stigma of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq identity , he said . friday s webinar was streamed at 8pm on today s instagram and tiktok accounts . the topic for the second instalment of this year s four part webinar series was on youth attitudes on lgbtq issues . the event was moderated by cna presenter elizabeth neo and also featured today s supervising editor yasmine yahya as a panellist . media portrayal of lgbtq community the panellists of the webinar also discussed the portrayal of lgbtq individuals in the media . today s survey found that a third of the respondents 33 per cent felt that the community was positively portrayed , while almost half 46 per cent were neutral about it . about a fifth 22 per cent said that the portrayals were negative . on this , mr yeo said that it was not just enough to have representation of lgbtq individuals on screen , but also have accurate portrayals that did not dehumanise , rely on tropes or portray such individuals in a negative light . he cited the example of the chinese language drama series , my guardian angels , which aired on mediacorp s channel 8 last april . the series had faced criticism for featuring a paedophile character who molested teenage boys and had sexually transmitted diseases as well as a character who was worried about the sexual orientation of her son . mediacorp had apologised last july for causing offence and distress , and reiterated that there was no intention to depict the lgbtq community in a negative light in the series . such portrayals perpetuated stereotypes of the lgbtq community , such as how gay people spread sexually transmitted diseases and are sexual predators , mr yeo said . as individuals with aspirations and dreams , members of the lgbtq community would appreciate positive portrayals in the media , he added . on the portrayal of lgbtq issues in the news media , ms yasmine said that today is still navigating its way on how to report such issues fairly without flouting laws on how they could be portrayed . today has thus tried to centre the community s voice in an accurate , fair and non judgemental way in the hope that reports on lgbtq issues will be read by the wider public , she said . legislation the panellists also touched on the question of whether lgbtq individuals can be equals in singapore without legislative changes , such as the repeal of section 377a of the penal code that criminalises consensual sex between men . to this , ms yasmine said that only time will tell if there will be legal changes in singapore , but in the meantime , individuals can create safe spaces for lgbtq persons in their work settings , social spaces or at home . mr yeo said that even if section 377a is repealed , mindsets about the lgbtq community , such as how it is here to tear apart the fabric of society , must also change . if anything , we are all for stability and cohesion as well . we want to be part of this society as much as you are . we want to feel like we belong . building consensus ms neo asked the panel about the concerns of people in society who are opposed to the normalisation of lgbtq issues . dr mathews said that it stems from how people frame the idea of a family . these segments of the population have questions about an alternative way of running a family , whether it would be viable and its impact on children of homosexual families . on whether different segments of society will ever reach a consensus on lgbtq issues , ms yasmine said that it is not possible to convert everybody . drawing parallels with the feminist movement , she said that there will always be pushback from society whenever progress is made . however , society must keep fighting for change while trying to reach across the divide and build bridges between groups who have opposing views , she added . agreeing , mr yeo said that it is not possible to force someone to agree in something they do not believe . however , it is important that the different groups are mature and open minded enough to listen and be receptive to what the other side is saying . he added if there s no willingness to sit down and have a proper discussion , then the battle is already lost .

org resource denied work an audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in singapore," but conversely , there is no need for affirmative action as imo , it is very insulting as it implies that they have to resort to policies , rather than their own efforts , to be selected . affirmative action is meant to counter inequality . if you accept that lgbtq people are currently discriminated against and not treated equally , it would thus make sense to be in favour of affirmative action to even out the playing field . for example , say xiao hua is a trans woman with qualifications that would otherwise give her 50 chance of getting an interview . she applies to 10 companies . if she wasn t trans , she would likely get 5 interviews . however , 8 out of the 10 companies refuse to hire trans people . so out of the remaining 2 who treat everyone fairly , she only gets 1 interview , and thus overall loses out compared to her equally or less qualified non trans peers . however , say those 2 other companies engaged in affirmative action that prioritise hiring lgbtq people , and give them lower barriers to entry . this would mean that she stands a better chance at getting 2 interviews instead of 1 . it s still much less than the 5 that she is actually qualified for , but every bit helps . ultimately , the goal would be to eradicate discrimination so that lgbtq people have the same chances as everyone else to get hired based on their ability , and when that happens , there would be no more need for that affirmative action . this doesn t say anything about lgbtq people s own efforts , because when the status quo is discriminatory , only the very best performers stand a chance at achieving what the average person does . which is good for those people , but it still leaves average or below average lgbtq performers struggling in ways that their non lgbtq peers do not have to . on a tangent if anyone is interested , the asia pacific transgender network found that employment discrimination against trans people was worst in singapore compared to malaysia , vietnam and thailand overall , our data indicated that the worst discrimination against trans people was in singapore , with trans women and trans men affected to a similar extent . cis applicants there were 81 . 5 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response 76 . 5 percent more likely for cis women and 90 percent for cis men , and 107 . 2 percent more likely to get invited to interview , more than double 112 . 5 percent for cis women and 100 percent for cis men . they also elsewhere noted that for trans female applicants , some of those interviews turned out to be sexual solicitations . source https weareaptn . org resource denied work an audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in singapore ",17-11-2022 10:49,Reddit,gender identity,-1

trans women using the male toilets get harassed a lot .,"i agree that people may be uncomfortable , but safety is more important . trans women using the male toilets get harassed a lot . some get beaten up or molested . overseas they have been raped or killed . so usually that s not an option once they have started transitioning and looking less male . unisex toilets aren t always available , which is why sometimes the female toilets are the safest option for them . but in that scenario , it s also not realistic that they would just walk in brazenly , because the whole reason for avoiding the male toilets is not to draw attention to themselves . hence the issue is how to manage that discomfort for both the trans person and others there , like by having friends come along , or having more unisex toilets , instead of forcing them to only use the male toilets where they could be in danger . with time , that discomfort will also go away once more people get to know more trans people . i had that same discomfort too , but at this point i ve met hundreds of other trans people in sg , and they re just people . one of them did sexually harass me , while also being really trans and not pretending . i ve also been sexually harassed by non trans women , including one aunty with mental health issues who stalked me for months , which is why i don t consider someone s gender the best way to figure out if they re a potential sex predator .

there are multiple cut off points when it comes to kids who express symptoms of gender dysphoria finding out if this is a matter of interests or identity .,"the medical criteria for puberty blockers for trans youths requires a long lasting and intense gender dysphoria , though i m not sure how long they mean . i understand the unfortunate trauma of the permanent effects of puberty . but won t puberty blockers have the same effect , just on the other end of the spectrum . it wouldn t , because puberty blockers delay those permanent changes rather than cause them . it s also the opposite of a life long decision . not going on blockers would be a life long decision , as would going on hormone therapy . gender identity is a complex structure . kids may be non hetero normative but that may not translate to wanting to change their body . i agree , and those kids are unlikely to be given blockers to begin with . there are multiple cut off points when it comes to kids who express symptoms of gender dysphoria finding out if this is a matter of interests or identity . e . g . is this a boy who simply prefers feminine interests and gets upset when he s denied them ? what happens when he s allowed to play with whatever he wants and dress however he likes ? if he s satisfied with that , then this is a gender non conforming kid , and is statistically likely to grow up to be gay . no further action is needed . but if that is not enough and being allowed to wear dresses or play with barbies doesn t seem to address the problem at all , with the kid still being very upset at being called a boy , and wanting to be a girl and have a girls name , with no other foreseeable causes e . g . perhaps the kid has a sister who is treated favourably , then chances are that this is a trans girl . perhaps parents can try out using a more feminine name nickname , and changing other specific sources of distress using a harm reduction approach . this may involve a full social transition . the kid may or may not grow up to be a trans woman . or perhaps like the person you mentioned , they may fluctuate between feeling male or female . as puberty approaches , if some of that prior distress starts returning due to fear over the upcoming changes , and the child explicitly expresses not wanting a male body but a female one , then puberty blockers becomes a consideration . this requires another assessment to reconfirm the gender dysphoria diagnosis , as well as to see if there are other mental health conditions which may cause an issue . if the dysphoria is tolerable , they may choose to wait until the child is older and or it becomes intolerable . they may choose to go through puberty first and only go on blockers or hrt a few years later in their teens , depending on how they feel then . but if the distress is acute , like if the kid s gender identity is unambiguous , they re crying every day and attempting to cut off their genitals with scissors , then blockers would be recommended . there was a report floating around a few years ago that showed that not all diagnosed trans children desire puberty blockers of those who do , not all are assessed to be suitable for treatment of those who are , not all choose to undergo treatment . the cost itself can be a significant deterrent , because it s about usd 1 , 500 a month . either way , it s not something that s simply given to kids if they express any symptoms of gender dysphoria . treatment for trans youths is focused on harm reduction and doing things step by step to resolve gender dysphoria , with medical intervention being the last resort when it is actively requested and other measures aren t sufficient . minimum age for hrt in singapore is 21 without parental consent , though . 17 with parental consent . and that can definitely be lowered because it s only pushing a lot of desperate trans youths to the black market , since by 21 most changes are irreversible and will stay with them for life .

if you asked any practitioner of abrahamic religions even a hundred years ago , they d tell you it s objectively fair for women to be expected to stay at home and be a good wife , for it is their god ordained role . who s to say future generations would not look upon what we think of as objectively fair and scoff ? it s not even a straight march towards more liberalism . some ancient civilisations such as rome viewed homosexuality more liberally than many western civilisations in the 20th century , for example ! this moral objectivist belief , in its modern form , can often be linked to the colonial mindset and the white man s burden , so it s a little amusing to see a singaporean espousing this . https plato . stanford . edu entries moral relativism nonetheless , the increased awareness of moral diversity especially between western and non western cultures on the part of europeans in the modern era is an important antecedent to the contemporary concern with moral relativism . during this time , the predominant view among europeans and their colonial progeny was that their moral values were superior to the moral values of other cultures . even if we believe in that , it s a massive leap of faith to think that the government always knows better , especially when it comes to human rights ! what was the right thing to do in those cases ? the right thing to do is to find out what the people want , and do it . which countries ? plenty of countries like the us , germany and canada disprove your narrative . are they less democratic than singapore ? i literally listed a few examples of countries that require referendum for constitutional amendments . please read . also , why would those countries be less democratic than singapore simply because they follow the same practice of allowing constitutional amendment purely via legislation ? at most , you can conclude that they re roughly equally democratic , though even that is quite a stretch because this is but one measure of democracy . refer above . that s not the only way to do so . i also see no mention of a referendum in denmark s case . no one said referendum is the only way . it s the more democratic way . also , re . denmark https constitutional change . com recent constitutional revision debate in denmark furthermore , in 2009 the danish act of succession was amended in order to introduce gender equality . this amendment could only be carried out by following the procedure for changing the constitution . this procedure is very comprehensive and includes a referendum in which a majority of those voting and at least 40 percent of all those entitled to vote must vote in favor of the proposed amendments . this criterion is hard to fulfill and gender equality as regards succession to the throne has always been mentioned as a popular question which could be used to engage the voters in a general revision of the constitution . however , this opportunity was bypassed as the politicians only initiated an amendment of the act of succession . this raised some public debate and some voters voted against the amendment in order to show their protest against the fact that no steps were taken towards a general revision of the constitution . why would i assume when polls exist on the issue of lgbt rights ? polls that show opinions shifting significantly even in the last 5 years , and suggest that a majority of singaporeans might support same sex marriage soon ? https en . wikipedia . org wiki lgbt rights in singapore according to the past few years of polling according to 2013 polling , some 75 of singaporeans opposed same sex marriage . in 2019 , a poll conducted by yougov with 1 , 033 respondents showed that about one third 34 of singaporeans backed same sex partnerships , while 43 opposed their legalization , and the remaining 23 were uncertain . a 2019 poll conducted by the institute of policy studies found that opposition to same sex marriage in singapore had fallen to 60 , down from 74 in 2013 . the poll also found that nearly six in ten singaporeans aged between 18 and 25 believed same sex marriage is not wrong . what gives you moral high ground over those you disagree with anyway ? why do you think you re better ? who do you think you are , to believe you have the right to bulldoze over what others believe in and push through with what you want , instead of actually trying to be an activist for your beliefs and trying to change minds ? ergo rule of the majority , because clearly those of the lgbt community or even our youth are being ignored by continuing with this status quo . and as such , other political parties mostly wp that are willing to cater more to these groups are gaining political prominence , forcing the pap to respond ! anyway , it is true . minorities often need allies from majority demographics to tilt the scales in their favour . that s why , for example , blm allies are such a prominent part of the movement in the us . this is the nature of the beast , however it is still better than the alternative , which are political systems where no one s rights are being looked after except for a small minority aristocrats , ruling class , etc . , depending on system . your perceived alternative is to rely on benevolent undemocratic rulers . that is not really viable long term . even the most benevolent party can be corrupted by those seeking power , and while democracy is often sub optimal compared to the hypothetical benevolent dictator , it s a relatively stable system over the longer term . benevolent dictators may or may not manage their succession well , and it is very possible for power to slip into the wrong hands over a few generations . through elections and voting for their representatives . it certainly doesn t mean that their representatives have to do everything that citizens want . literally no democracy works that way . of course , not everything representatives do reflect what people want . we re still talking about rights , right ? rights aren t minor pieces of regulation like the day to day regulatory powers of mas . no one really cares enough to use their political power as a citizen to influence that unless they work in the industry or if something goes seriously wrong eg . us in 2009 and dodd frank , a remarkably popular piece of financial legislation . we re talking about rights that are enshrined in the constitution here . constitutional amendments should involve the citizenry , and often do , even in countries that do not require referendum . that it doesn t happen in singapore is actually kinda ridiculous , and is one of the reasons a supermajority in parliament is harmful .

"stigma can happen in very subtle ways , even if the gay marriage is legal on paper .","1 . yes , op didn t ask for acceptance from every person . however op did talked about the general acceptance of the alt lifestyle as also another normal , from both the workforce and family before moving onto the equality part . quote while 377a is not strictly enforced , it is still in place to preserve traditional family values . we want acceptance from our parents and not have the fear of getting kicked out of the house . we have to be recognised as husbands wives without having the fear that our sexuality will affect our career especially for those in the govt sector . unquote in the last quoted sentence , op seem to imply that the legal effect of gay marriage law will eliminate the fear of their sexuality affecting their career . it is simply not true . stigma can happen in very subtle ways , even if the gay marriage is legal on paper . 2 . op did mention about education . quote and it sucks because of the lack of education about sexuality in singapore . no teachers or adults ever talked about it . unquote there seem to be a suggested frustration towards our current curriculum not being accepting other genders hence it is unable to help confused youngsters come to terms with their ssa . also , if the 377a is repealed , the next step is to legalize gay marriage . absolutely right because it is naturally the next step . now if you have already legalize the act between same sex as well as marriage , shouldn t you also be teaching about the different genders in school as part of sex ed ? how can you accept gay marriage but not change sex ed ? isn t that tantamount to discrimination , no ? on the law level you accept other genders , but in school you don t ? does that make sense ? wouldn t not changing sex ed to accommodate other genders be equivalent to being homophobic ? this is the line of thought . am i jumping the gun ? nope because that s how it was done in the west . it is not logical to only stop at gay marriage . it is the natural road of progression . to say you accept same sex union without changing school curriculum to educate the younger singaporeans on other genders is almost like you look into the mirror , only to forget how you look like after you walk away . 3 . op was using a bible verse to justify how if we love someone , we should accept them as who they are , to which i quoted another bible verse that said about correcting someone whom you love . i was just trying to put that neighbor love into context . that love also includes loving discipline . nothing about correcting anybody . like how a mother would correct a wayward son not because she hates him , but because she loved him . love does not equate full acceptance was the point i was trying to bring up . 4 . well it clearly make difference when it comes to acquiring hdbs and marriage etc . but since op was on the topic of acceptance , it does not make a difference because stigma will still be there anyways . so we repeal 377a ? coz it helps them get hdbs and a proper marriage license ? sounds good . but again , what about point 2 ? it doesn t just stop there . it is not logical . as i have brought up about the gender less toilet in my earlier post , that is also a part of the logical progression . since there are more than just two genders , how can we discriminate the other genders by only having just two gendered toilets ? if the school teaches about multiple genders , why aren t the toilets showing more than two genders ? it happened in the us and children got sexually assaulted by men identifying as female in toilets . all of these will eventually intrude into the lives of the majority because it affects everyone . and you cannot impose the preference of the minorities at the expense of the majority . as for the issue on hdb , well it can be resolved by renting an apartment outside , until you reach the age of 35 . there s no systematic oppression in singapore . homosexuals have their safe space here . they don t get sentenced to jail just for being homosexuals like in the middle east . they get to host pink dot every year without police arresting them and government stopping the event . so things are fine as they are . hence , for the reasons mentioned above , i support 377a . its more than just hdbs and marriage acceptance or even society acceptance . i genuinely hope everyone here at the very least do their own research and look into what happened after gay marriage was passed in other countries . look into facts . not those sensational headlines . if after looking into all of that , you still disagree with me , thats fine with me . really . all i just hope is that everyone arrive at their stand through evidences , facts and logic instead of emotions .

"mr ravi argued that parliament s stance that section 377a will not be proactively enforced interferes with article 9 1 of the constitution , as it leads to an inconsistent and arbitrary application of criminal procedure as well as being incongruous with the mandatory obligation under section 424 of the cpc ."," sexual orientation cannot be wilfully changed , say lawyers fighting to repeal section 377a singapore sexual orientation cannot be wilfully changed and is a product of genetic and environmental factors , said lawyers arguing for the repeal of section 377a of the penal code . they argued that the law , which criminalises acts of gross indecency between men , violates article 9 of the constitution guaranteeing the right to life and personal liberty , and article 14 guaranteeing freedom of expression . the legal team , consisting of mr eugene thuraisingam , mr suang wijaya and mr johannes hadi of the eugene thuraisingam law firm , represented disc jockey johnson ong ming in the high court on monday nov 18 in the second of three cases to be brought against section 377a this month . the attorney general s chambers agc has been listed as the respondent in all of the cases . mr ong s lawyers presented expert evidence from six medical professionals to back up their claims , including three called by mr ong and three called by the agc . those called by mr ong were british psychiatrist dinesh bhugra , a professor of mental health and diversity at the institute of psychiatry at king s college london dr jacob rajesh , a senior consultant psychiatrist at the promises clinic in novena medical centre and american public health and epidemiology professor chris beyrer of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health . those called by the agc were dr cai yiming , an emeritus consultant in the department of developmental psychiatry at the institute of mental health retired geneticist john tay sin hock , who was the former head of division of human genetics at the national university of singapore and dr derrick heng mok kwee , group director of the public health group in the ministry of health . the experts on both sides largely agree that sexual orientation cannot be wilfully changed and that biological factors such as one s genes and non social environmental factors such as exposure to different levels of hormones in the womb are contributors to one s sexual orientation , the lawyers argued . there is also no credible scientific evidence that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation , such as reparative or conversion therapy , is safe or effective , they added . but the experts differed on whether choice and social environmental factors like culture play a role in determining sexual orientation . dr cai said there is very little we can scientifically conclude about whether there is choice in sexual orientation . related story section 377a was intended to stop british civil servants visiting male prostitutes lawyers dr tay said that genetics may play some part in determining sexual orientation but are not the sole cause of it , suggesting that culture plays a role as well . mr ong s lawyers contended that the scientific literature cited by dr cai contradicted his conclusion . they also argued that dr tay did not cite any evidence to support his conclusion that cultural factors play such a role . it is absurd , irrational and discriminatory to criminalise a person on the basis of his natural , unchangeable identity and for non harmful private acts , the team said in a statement to the media summarising their arguments . the lawyers noted that their case differs from a previous case brought against section 377a in 2010 by mr tan eng hong , whose lawyer had argued that there was overwhelming evidence that a person s sexual orientation is biologically determined . mr tan had provided the court with statements from medical and scientific bodies which were not formally entered as evidence , they said . for the first time , there is expert evidence before the courts on the nature of sexual orientation . in the previous cases , the court was only asked to take judicial notice of scientific facts which required a different legal test , the lawyers said in their statement . the first case , brought by mr bryan choong chee hong , 42 , the former executive director of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt non profit oogachaga , was heard last week . the third case , brought by lgbt activist and retired general practitioner tan seng kee , was also heard on monday . related story section 377a moving beyond slippery slopes to a rational consensus related story gay rights will remain one of singapore s most intractable knots mr m . ravi of carson law chambers , who represented dr tan , argued that other laws make it legally obligatory for anyone to report those who violate section 377a , including gay men themselves , their friends or family members , and their medical care providers . for example , section 424 of the criminal procedure code cpc states that every person aware of the commission of or the intention of any other person to commit any arrestable offence punishable under chapter xvi of the penal code , among others , shall report that commission or intention to the police . section 377a falls under chapter xvi of the penal code . mr ravi argued that parliament s stance that section 377a will not be proactively enforced interferes with article 9 1 of the constitution , as it leads to an inconsistent and arbitrary application of criminal procedure as well as being incongruous with the mandatory obligation under section 424 of the cpc . the three cases were heard by justice see kee oon in chambers and were not open to the public . the agc began its submissions on monday and will conclude later this week . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",18-11-2019

the majority that supports retaining 377a is ever shrinking and the asian culture excuse is being chipped away by countries like taiwan and thailand .," that s not guaranteed . of course it s not guaranteed , but it s far more likely the status quo will change in 10 20 years given the rapid shift we re seeing . 36 of respondents , a very significant number , is so apathetic that they wouldn t even give a yes no answer to a possibly anonymised ? survey . if you looked at previous ipsos polls , that just represents the who are neutral about it . when it comes to this , neutrality isn t necessarily bad . so , by and large , singapore might still lack strong political interest in the matter to prompt serious discussion or even change in the near future . i think you re underestimating how accelerated the changes to the status quo becomes as the older generation die out and the younger generation replaces them as voters . even thailand s lawmakers gave initial approval to legalising same sex unions just yesterday . it may not happen in the near future i . e . next 5 years , but there s no way singapore can ignore the issue in 10 20 years . to be honest , singaporeans in general do not have the reputation of strongly supporting social causes . yeah , but you re seeing the younger generation care more about social causes too . all these small shifts add up and snowball over time . without sufficiently strong pressure , especially from a strong core of people with strong opinions on the issue , there is not a lot of political impetus to visit this issue . right , but why do you assume the pressure on parliament to address this issue isn t going to increase moving forwards ? is singapore this magical exception that will escape what happened in other countries with a younger generation that s more progressive ? i find that very doubtful . he swing is definitely not linear that goes from 55 to 44 to 0 in 16 years no , but the swing is more likely to accelerate , notably if you look at trends from other countries . certainly , look at past polls , the shift doesn t look like it s going to lose momentum any time soon . at some point it would plateau due to strong supporters for 377a . except it s going to plateau in favor of repealing 377a . have you seen the breakdown of support oppose by age ? the majority of 30 years olds already support repealing 377a . not only , those with no religions support repealing 377a more than they oppose it , and that group is also growing in singapore . it s not like repeal will be guaranteed to shoot up 8 every 4 years to 50 in 15 years . why not ? that actually has been the trend , give or take a few , with past surveys . really though , at its core , this survey is a strong indication of the fact that the pap s two common excuses are not going to be valid forever . the majority that supports retaining 377a is ever shrinking and the asian culture excuse is being chipped away by countries like taiwan and thailand . that gives you confidence to bet everything on it . this is great news and a bolster for those currently pushing for equal lgbt rights , certainly to keep the momentum going or even to accelerate it . i m absolutely not betting anything on it , but i see a lot of hope for future generations to not have to go through what others like myself have had to .

can sign with your name , initials , pseudonym or whatever you are comfortable with . for public circulation 277 signatories last updated 24 jan 2021 , 5 . 19pm we , the undersigned , are teachers , counsellors , social workers , and community youth workers in from singapore . we were distressed to read about a transgender student 146 s experience of discrimination at her school , including claims that the ministry of education , singapore moe and her school interfered to stop her from receiving the hormone therapy that her doctor advised . in response , moe denied involvement while misgendering her in their statement 16 jan . the student has continued to share her name , ashlee , and further details with the straits times and today . as education and social service professionals , we have witnessed and heard about similar situations faced by transgender students in singapore schools . we apologise for any way in which we may have made transgender and other lgbtq students feel unsafe or unwelcome at school . we want to do better by our young people . we are aware of the evidence that transgender youths face higher risks of depression and suicide when prevented from transitioning . delaying transition is not always an option , especially for students with severe gender dysphoria . it is our duty as school leaders , teachers and counsellors to help them manage the challenges that arise from transitioning at school , not to add to them or look away . we hold moe to their promise that they will 147 work closely with and respect the professional advice given by moh 146 s healthcare professionals 148 . on this basis , we call on the ministry to implement and communicate a clear policy on supporting transgender students at schools , in line with advice from healthcare professionals , and in consultation with the respective students and their families . this policy should include advising school leaders , teachers and counsellors that they should defer to healthcare professionals in all decisions pertaining to a student 146 s physical and mental health , gender presentation , and transition , without interference from school leaders , teachers or counsellors and regardless of their personal preferences or beliefs . there should not be any pressure or interference from the school towards the student or their doctors to either withhold gender transition or to hasten medical procedures e . g . rushing surgeries that would enable the student to change their legal sex . administrative concerns should never take precedence over a student 146 s life , health , education , and well being . as an act of care and respect , school leaders and staff should make efforts to respect the expressed gender of students who have trusted us enough to share their transgender identities . as an extension of that trust , a student s transgender identity should not be revealed to or discussed with their parents without the student s prior consent . there should be no institutional or personal threats made to any student , their family , or their doctors . schools should proactively offer though not mandate supportive counselling and other mental health services to transgender students . these counsellors should not condemn or pressure students to change their gender identities . there should be greater transparency and accountability if any school leaders , teachers or counsellors were to go against these guidelines . we also note that moe 146 s statement advised 147 students who experience unkind behaviour from peers to approach the teachers or school leaders as they are committed to keep students safe 148 . we are unfortunately aware of transgender students who sought help only to be punished as discipline cases , outed to their parents without their consent , or referred to programmes aiming to change their sexual orientation or gender identity . this has kept many others from seeking help out of fear . we call on moe to take action on their words by working to equip schools to create a safe school environment for all students , including transgender students . this could , among other things , take the form of inclusive policies , training for all teachers and counsellors on gender dysphoria and lgbtq issues , inclusive sexuality education and anti bullying programmes , and having a statement of inclusion for schools and counsellors to abide by . many of us were afraid to write this statement or put our names to it because we recognise that it is still not safe for us as individuals and professionals to publicly express these views . nevertheless , we are making this statement because we believe that it is the right thing to do , and because it is our professional duty to protect and care for all the young people we teach , counsel and guide . signatories individuals 277 signatories last updated 24 jan 2021 , 5 . 19pm a , teacher a sherry , filmmaker abdul rahman khan , former tutor afiqah ,

"we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war .","we all know that any developed country outside of sea region and ccp does not criminalised people just becus they are specifically gendered male and have sex with each other . even india does not criminalise . thats blunt sense moronic , to criminalise something specifically based on gender . apologies if you disagree . even india moves on from the ruling many years back . the way you are putting it , its like just because other countries are doing it , we should do it too . so if other countries are abolishing or has already abolished death sentence for drug smugglers , we should blindly follow ? blind following the blind ? with out the independence of mind ? shoudn t the final outsome , even if it results in the abolishment of the act , be made with the indepencence of mind ? at least justifty your support for the abolishment of 377a with better logic . majority of these less developed sea countries will properly side ccp in the upcoming war . so you are really just associating your ideal values with them . since the early 2010s , honestly people all over the globe dont really anti male homo people anymore . why again are you mentioning about the ccp ? they are the only ones against abolishment of 377a like laws ? what about those states where gay sex is punishable by death . quite a few of them around . and they fare worse then ccp in terms of gay rights . but no mention of it from you . but just solely on ccp . i wonder why . we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war . so you are spilling over your dislike of ccp in regards to those matters to this ? if you really feel that homosexuality is immoral for the sake of so called moral values , you wouldn t even criminalise just male people , male people specifically were targeted because people who make these rules are mostly male people and are just over paranoid that without these laws and ruling , they themselves will turn homosexual . there is a term called homophobia , this is what you sound like more rather than people preaching good people values . the part in bold , that s one of the worst logic i ever heard . i mean serious ? can see you are no longer logical . not sure what you are smoking there . what next ? law makers are coming are with anti robbery laws because they are afraid they might become robbers themselves ? then they might as well not have the law and enjoy themselves by making it legal fulfilling their desires or tendencies legallly rather then fighting against their innate desires , why go through all the trouble ? as for the homesexuality part being immoral . not sure why you brought up the immoral part . a celibate homosexual is more moral than a promiscuous hetereosexual . a better way to put it is , its against nature rather then immoral . heterosexuality is part of human evolution in terms of the continuance of human population . not to mention , those body parts when in unison , were not mean to perform those task , which is why proportionally there is a higher risk of contracting stds , hiv , monkeypox , suffering from incontinence etc . in gays then heterosexuals . . because nature did not mean those body parts for that . which is why i support maintaining status quo not further tightening of the law . by that , i mean the law existing in name to permeate the state of mind that gay sex is discouraged , even though the act was no longer stricly enforced while not actually in most cases punishing gay sex itself . which is i believe the most popular sentiment among the general population excluding lgbts it would have been better to strengthen or come up protective laws against depriving gays , lgbts who are out of the closet , of job opportunities , etc . rather then repealing the act . problems is , there are people like you who like to jump to conclusions . not supporting the repealing of the act gays should be punished heavily or homophobia blah blah . of course i am not ruling out the existence of such people . but there are different schools of thought even among those who do not support the repealing of the act . some take a more aggressive stance , some take a more middle ground . regarding good values , you have good values because you support repealing of the act ? seems like quite a loose definition of good values if so . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . not sure if repealing of the act , but embedding the defintion of marriage only between man and women into the contsitution , making it not challengable in court is exactly boost the international image , attract more international investments that u define . maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . nah , i don t take it personally . hope you seriously don t too . i am also fine that you are the judge of howthose who dun support repealing of the act are , traditionalists , suck at justifying and challenging , and not being able to accept new norms . after all , delusional or not , your opinions and sentiments must be superior to those that contrast to you and it is the universal truth . and yes , i believe you are not even a pro homo person after reading your post which is not even actually pro homo .

"this approach is actually very impractical in practice given how the required surgeries are extremely expensive about 30k for trans women , 100k for trans men and cannot be covered by insurance , the vast majority of trans people in singapore about 90 , based on a survey of 240 respondents have never managed to change our ics , largely for financial reasons .","this approach is actually very impractical in practice given how the required surgeries are extremely expensive about 30k for trans women , 100k for trans men and cannot be covered by insurance , the vast majority of trans people in singapore about 90 , based on a survey of 240 respondents have never managed to change our ics , largely for financial reasons . most trans people here are also low income and there s a high unemployment rate , which puts it even further out of reach and creates a vicious cycle where having a mismatched ic makes it difficult to get a job since it outs them as trans , which then makes it difficult to afford surgery to change the ic . there is also a high risk of medical risks and complications , especially for trans men who additionally need multiple surgeries over 1 2 years . a local surgeon allegedly has a 1 in 3 fatality rate for trans men . most can t afford the time off work for the months of recovery , and if they have parents or other family members depending on them , they may not want to take the risk . conversely , hormone therapy is much more affordable and is what changes one s external appearance and sexual characteristics . many trans people thus choose to just do that and find it sufficient to alleviate gender dysphoria and allow us to live as our gender . so this means that there is a large number of trans people who look like and live as one sex but are legally another . it s the case for me . i ve been on testosterone for over 10 years and had top surgery . most people in my life including my colleagues only know me as a guy , but my ic says f . it s an administrative nightmare that inconveniences not just me but others . for example , i ve been denied phone banking services because i sound like a guy on the phone but my account says ms and they refused to believe it was me . another time , a covid testing batch was held up when i asked about the delay the nurses said they worried they got the results messed up since my record said i was a female patient , so i explained i was trans . it also makes travelling overseas dangerous , such as to malaysia and indonesia where being trans is illegal , or to the us where anti trans hatred is at a peak and people have guns . on a day to day basis it means repeatedly outing myself whenever i need to show my ic or interact with any institution that lists me as ms , and it s pretty stressful having to repeatedly tell strangers that i m trans , especially when not all of them react well . i know that many people consider surgery a good criteria because when the policy was first set in the 1970s , it was with trans women in mind , and it was often the only form of medical transition that trans people did . but it s been 50 years and there have been many advances in trans healthcare since then , especially with the rise in use of hrt , such that we really need to relook at those policies .

"secondly , the results tally with many more studies of the positive mental health effects of hormone therapy and surgery for trans adults , some of which is objectively measurable e ."," if you look at the democratic party in the usa , they werent always supportive of lgbt community that was the case of the world at large , though , as well as for many people i know , including my parents . views change , especially when someone comes to personally know more lgbt people . the christian church in the us is also an example of that just a few years ago , the vast majority strongly opposed lgbt rights , whereas now more than half are supportive . and what changed wasn t any political agenda to get votes but more lgbt people coming out to their friends and families and making it harder for them to be demonised as a separate group that had nothing to do with normal society . i think it does a great disservice to the work and sacrifices made by countless activists and lgbt people making those personal connections , to dismiss it all as the workings of some insidious political conspiracy just out to get votes . the same democratic party is so keen on championing illegal immigrants to stay in safe city that wont deport them because they represent an untapped voter base those people can t vote . but as i recall when the lgbt movement was young , there were gay members who wanted carnal relationship with a much younger population and they arose from the lgbt movement and started nambla after they got kicked out pedophiles who were attracted to and pursued relationships with boys may have found themselves banding together with gay men in a society that was very hostile towards both groups and considered both to be an expression of aberrant if not criminal sexuality . this doesn t make them gay men nor representative of gay men . the atmosphere back then was also very different even among straight people , a lot of what was considered acceptable sexual behaviour , such as straight men getting women drunk to have sex with them , or grabbing random women to kiss them in bouts of spontaneous passion , would today be recognised as sexual assault . from what i understand , the climate then also meant that a lot of young gay teenagers found themselves kicked out of their homes and left to survive on the streets . many ended up seeking out the gay community for refuge , where older gay men took them under their wing and sometimes ended up in sexual relationships with them . this does not make it acceptable . but i can understand why it happened , and it s also very different from a situation where an adult man knowingly seeks out to exploit a child s innocence by coercing or luring them into a relationship . one reason why pursuing sex with children is so wrong is because it robs them of their innocence . those gay teens lost their innocence long ago . i think many of their adult partners were also not aware that this was wrong , because many were deeply sexually broken and had never had the opportunity to learn otherwise . the only thing they were taught was that all their sexual desires were equally wrong and worthy of punishment . the wider society didn t recognise any distinction between men having sex with men or with boys , and so while i don t condone this in the least , it s to be expected that the men in question likewise did not recognise that distinction . but that has changed , which is why nambla got kicked out . right now , the vast majority of gay men and especially the larger lgbt community recognise the moral repulsiveness of having sex with children , and if anything , they are the primary drivers of the message that consent is crucial to any sexual relationship , and that children and young teens are incapable of giving that consent . the puberty blocker drugs are gnrh agonist hormones which come with significant risk pertaining to suicide , depression and anxiety yeah , i ve heard that , which is what makes it all the more significant that trans youth who go on puberty blockers have remarkably lower rates of suicide , depression and anxiety compared to trans youth who do not receive that treatment . just a cursory look revealed some interesting questions that the articles failed to address such as confounders or that questionaires are generally low tier in the hierarchy of evidence i agree , but firstly when trans youth are almost consistently very depressed , anxious and suicidal except for this one group , it s still the best option if erring on the side of caution the fact that they were even alive after 7 years to do those questionnaires is remarkable in itself . secondly , the results tally with many more studies of the positive mental health effects of hormone therapy and surgery for trans adults , some of which is objectively measurable e . g . stress hormone levels in blood . anecdotally , i m close friends with many trans people and have had casual contact with perhaps over a thousand through my activist work and online trans communities . i ve seen the positive results of transition first hand in both their lives and my own things like friends who used to cry all the time and regularly attempt suicide but then transitioned and are now very happy , haven t cried even once since then , and are living fulfilling lives . these examples are happening over and over again in every single trans person i have personally known , including trans children whose parents i m in touch with . the difference transition including blockers makes is extremely palpable , and while higher tier evidence is understandably required to make conclusions in academic studies , it isn t something that s necessary to recognise the difference between a deeply depressed child and a happy one . while i can understand people wanting more time to do long term studies , it s the best default option for now , given what evidence we have .
