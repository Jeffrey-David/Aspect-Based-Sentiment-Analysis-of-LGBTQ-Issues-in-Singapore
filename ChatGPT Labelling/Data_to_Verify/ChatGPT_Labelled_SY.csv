"the apa has redefined homosexuality from a mental illness to not a mental illness , because american society s perception has changed ."," 4 5 that s more than some of our minority races like the eurasians . are you saying that being a eurasian is abnormal ? exactly , which is why normal as a requirement for treated decently is a horrible requirement . end of discussion then . why keep wasting my time ? sorry , but i just don t see the point of having a conversation that s not going to be based on facts . it d be like debating someone who s anti vaxx or denies climate change if facts can t convince them , why would i waste time convincing otherwise ? because there is more to real life than facts . faith and beliefs are what make humans and society tick . by restricting yourself to facts , you blind yourself from reality , and thus you cannot think or act rationally . it s precisely the delusion that nothing is real except facts , sometimes known as scientism , that has contributed to the anti vaxx and anti climate change movements , because that makes it impossible to communicate with those holding different values . neither can religion ? beyond some book , what exactly is the basis to support the claim the homosexuality is morally wrong ? correct . so if your view and lawrence khong s view are of equal weight according to you , because science has no moral facts and he has no moral facts , and you deny that there is anything beyond facts , why should he listen to you ? meanwhile , science has already established that homosexuality is not a disorder or illness and that both homosexuality and heterosexuality are normal aspects of human sexuality . science has not , because what is defined as mental illness was never scientifically defined , but socially defined . the apa has redefined homosexuality from a mental illness to not a mental illness , because american society s perception has changed . if you come from the viewpoint that social perception is reality . . . then in singapore homosexuality is a mental illness . if you come from the viewpoint that there are only facts and social perception doesn t matter . . . then the apa is unscientific and their view that homosexuality is not a disorder or illness is not a fact . yeah , why are we using morals to decide what rights a group gets ? do note that doing so has resulted in things like slavery , sexism , racism and islamophobia . great idea , right ? huh ? are you implying that your viewpoint is amoral because morals aren t factual ? if you have no morals , then why is treating lgbt people with respect any better than discriminating against them ? how can you even claim anything should be without morals ? the only thing you can conclude would be fact singapore society discriminates against lgbt . the end .

"coincidentally you brought up the point about being antagonistic , but can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being told their narrow minded definitions of marriage should coalesce with the idea of same sex marriage something born out of sexual attraction ?","apologies for a day late reply , was busy . there s alot of angsty downvoters who don t even dare to participate in discourse . you guys are the definition of circlejerk , and the reason why we can t have nice discussions on reddit , grow up please . singapore is a secular nation . marriage is not a religious one but a civil institution as per singaporean law . churches will also not be forced as it is in the us to perform same sex marriages . i never said we weren t a secular nation . i wholly agree we are a secular nation , and i detest people on the white shirt camp who invoke the bible to denounce gay marriage because it s against their beliefs . yes , churches will not be forced , but in the us , those who upset the gay community will face huge budget cuts , threatening their very survival . technically , they are still allowed to reject the marriage of gay couples . while facing minor consequences of course . can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being discriminated against i don t believe in discriminating against gay people . i treat them as fellow human beings . those who discriminate against them are doing so out of fear , and i abhor such practice . would anyone be fine with not having equal rights ? i assume the right you are talking about is the right to marry . this really frustrates me . marriage isn t a right , it s a privilege . which is why in singapore or anywhere in the civilised world , both parties must consent before a marriage licence can be issued . if marriage regardless of the sex was truly a right , we d have a shit ton of problems . we don t have the right to marry animals for example . and this privilege is decided by the state . proponents of gay marriage always argue that marriage is a social construct . this lends even more credibility to the argument that marriage is not something we should inherently be given , it is simply a privilege and a standard we humans have invented , and set to adhere to . are they advocating that christians be stripped of their basic rights a group that actively calls for another to have less rights again , marriage is not a right . unless you are talking about the right to be an individual , the right to be treated as a fellow human being . then what i have written above already addresses this . i don t think the majority of white shirts are advocating discrimination of gays , those who do are the religious zealots , and a convenient straw man for the pro pink dot to attack . would you give anti vaxxers or climate change deniers the same legitimacy these are debates that are fundamentally different in the fact that they do not involve social constructs . let me explain further . we don t give anti vaxxers legitimacy because it is scientifically untrue . if white shirts argued that homosexuality is unnatural , i wouldn t be giving them any legitimacy either , because it has already been scientifically proven it does occur in nature . however , the issue at hand is whether homosexuals should be granted marriage . and this is a social construct , something that science has little authority in . therefore yes , we have to grant the anti gay movement legitimacy because this isn t a science debate , this is a social debate that involves an institutional standard we have believed in and referenced for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . no one s saying homosexuality is a fabrication . but people are saying that marriage should not be extended to include homosexuality . people have followed the traditional construct of marriage for hundreds of years , and allowing homoesexuals to marry on the basis of sexual attraction trivialises this institution . think of it as christianity and buddhism if a bunch of buddhists decided to mix the 2 beliefs together and then proceed to tell christians that they should expand their definition of christianity to include them , aggressively asserting that it is their right to be recognised by christianity while calling others who oppose them as bigots and narrow minded , most people would disagree . because in this scenario you shouldn t be trying to identify with a religion , you have essentially created your own . coincidentally you brought up the point about being antagonistic , but can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being told their narrow minded definitions of marriage should coalesce with the idea of same sex marriage something born out of sexual attraction ? i haven t once invoked a non secular argument , and i believe that the secular case against gay marriage can be made . edit formatting",11-06-2016 22:56,Reddit,same sex marriage,-1

"you need to stop weaseling around the main point that you are spreading falsehoods about the catholic and the majority of the local protestant groups , because the issue isn t just 377a ."," first , please , refrain from putting words in my mouth . i only agree that protestants are worse . i don t acknowledge that one group is way worse feel free to quote me . it is very tiring to have to make these corrections , while at the same time being accused by your of lies and misinformation . ok so why call out catholics and angelicans a denomination of protestants who are relatively more passive than groups that organize anti lgbt campaigns as the main anti lgbt group and completely disregard the the groups who are actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? second , i use the term protestants generally simply because you have been using anglicans and catholics . it is long and tiring to have to say the other christians who are not anglicans or catholics , so i have used protestants . if you prefer another label that is convenient , i have no problems using that . thank you for confirming and proving my point . you have deep seated psychological issue that causes you to casually stereotype vastly different groups . here is what you said earlier you seem to be saying that hang on , the protestants are way worse ! they have their wear white campaign , and pray that it will rain on pink dot . you would rather further generalize and stereotype with protestant a 10 letter word , than use the acronyms of the groups that both organize wear white movement and have conversion therapy , both of which contain only 4 characters . essentially you are now saying angelicans , methodists , presbyterians , all of the seven local denominations actively participate in the wear white campaign . and your reasoning is because it is long and tiring . it literally takes less effort to actually not stereotype and name the actual groups . if that s not a prime example of stererotyping , i don t know what is . your psychological issue of casual stereotyping is propagating misinformation and falsehoods , and you need to stop . if you can t , i suggest you seek help , because people like you stir up dissent amongst peaceful relationships . by the way , the notion that not all protestants participate in or even support the wear white campaign , or conversion therapy . can simply be reversed to point out that not all catholics are opposed to wear white or conversion therapy . clearly , you will see variance in the nature of belief in any faith , so any discussion will necessarily have to encompass some degree of generalities . i m sure you recognize a fundamental difference between a group that teaches love and accept lgbt people and a group that teaches homosexuality is a mental illness . you even said it yourself that one is worse . so why are you still sterotyping both groups as one , while naming only the groups that are relatively more supportive and passive by not actually actively organizing anti lgbt movements , while refusing to admit you re willfully being obtuse by choosing to disregard the groups that are organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? i ve already explained that i still regard the differences as fairly minor , in the grand scheme of things . therefore you are admitting that you are sterotyping , and your intention is therefore to stir shit because you know and admit one group is worse than the other but you still support calling the group that is relatively more supportive and passive out and ignoring the group that is actively campaigning against lgbt . i know you re going to deny it , you can keep telling yourself that , but i really don t know how you sleep at night knowing that because you re too afraid to shatter your fragile ego , you refuse to admit that you would rather call the group that teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people out as the largest anti lgbt group while you completely disregard the actual group that organizes anti lgbt campaigns . to me , you are willfully spreading lies and misinformation that all churches have the same stand regarding lgbt , an issue that my lgbt friends and family have shown to be something they care about as it matters to them what their friends and family actually believe . it also matters to them that for all the acceptance of them , the catholic church still does not consider them able to get married . indeed , many might prefer the outright homophobia than that apparent hypocrisy of the catholic church . oh look , another strawman . what does it matter to my lgbt family or friends if the church doesn t consider them eligible for marriage ? they can get married outside of the church . my friend or family member doesn t have to be a christian to be my friend or family . my friend or family member doesn t have to agree with my beliefs to be my friend or family . . what matters to my friends and family is that im not prejudiced against them , nor do i think they have a mental illness that should be cured . you keep talking about 377a as if it s the only issue here , no it s not . you need to stop weaseling around the main point that you are spreading falsehoods about the catholic and the majority of the local protestant groups , because the issue isn t just 377a . it s also about the core teachings of the church and how it affects the daily relationships between lgbt people and church goers . to say that one group teaches love and acceptance and another teaches mental illness is a minor difference , on top of naming only the groups that teaches love and acceptance as anti lgbt out of seven protestant denominations while disregarding the group the teaches mental illness an obvious act of shit stirring . i don t ? for goodness sake for someone that complains over and over about lies and misinformation , you could do well to actually read what you are complaining over . i have clearly explained that while the churches have different approaches it s literally in my first post that the catholic church holds a less critical view , i regard the difference as minor . this is obviously different from the same view . so teaching love and accept lgbt people . don t discriminate , don t judge is a minor difference from homosexuality is a mental illness that should be cured . got it . i understand your stance clearly now . you re a shit stirrer , whether you want to admit it or not . and sorry , catholics are by no means the most supportive of lgbt people . i don t know where this idea is based from , but lgbt find much more support amongst secular support groups than the catholic church . even among religious groups , buddhists are far more accepting of lgbt people . just among christians , it is the free community church not catholic that actually supports lgbt people . come on , are you really that stupid ? is it not obvious enough that i m making the point within the confines of christianity ? let me put it simply for you then since you insist on playing dumb . amongst the christian groups , despite being passively supportive to 377a which is anti lgbt to a minor degree compared to actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns , catholics that teach love and accept lgbt people is the most supportive group compared to other groups that teach homosexuality is a mental illness and groups that actively hold anti lgbt campaigns . . is that better for you ? if you re going to talk about free community church then i m going to ask , why are you shifting the goal post to now include a church that isn t even on the national council of churches ? i literally mention protestants in my first post , which says that both the catholic church and the protestants are the main anti lgbt group . so why not just say christians ? the fact you separate the two groups show that you are not ignorant of the fact they have vastly different teachings regarding lgbt . and since you are not ignorant of that fact , why do you still sterotype them into having the same teaching and stance ? the catholic church is , as a matter of fact , anti lgbt , and you can t run away from that simply because some protestant churches are worse . i never said that they weren t . let me help you establish some facts . 1 the catholic church supports 377a . 2 most protestant groups support 377a . from these two facts , i ll give it to you that they are anti lgbt with regards only to 377a . 3 the catholic church teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people . 4 a certain denomination of the protestants group organizes the wear white campaign , an anti lgbt campaign . 5 a certain denomination of the protestants believe that homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured via conversion therapy . now , you yourself have admitted that there is a difference between the beliefs and teachings of the above mentioned groups . i m leaving out angelicans here for simplicity . however , you are still adamant in saying the difference is only minor , when clearly these teachings significantly affect the day to day relationships between lgbt people and church goers . 6 the person you are defending says that catholics and angelicans are the largest anti lgbt group . 7 the person you are defending clearly knows that he is singling out two specific groups , the catholic church , and the angelican church , which is only one out of at least seven local protestant denominations , and even excluded the non denominational churches by not categorizing the entire group as christians instead . given that the person knows very well there is a distinction between the groups , he still chose to single out group 3 , catholics , and the angelican church , and completely disregard groups 4 and 5 . tell me , what does this behavior look like to you ? why are you defending this ? clearly , you are a shit stirrer .

? ? type of fear mongering . there s a lot that could have been discussed and i think this debate could have taken up the entire hour , but in general i don t like the 3 16 s assumption that all respondents have researched opinions . i would hypothesise that they actually just answered in a way that supports the government s reasoning government says we are repealing 377a but keeping marriage s definition as m f . therefore 377a is bad . uphold definition of marriage as m f is good . we live in a effectively one party state , and i would say that the trickle down of opinions on social matters from the government could be the reason for this . if you disagree with my hypothesis , that s valid . unfortunately the today survey didn t ask why people responded this way . it just noted that religious people were more likely to support 377a s stay , and support the definition of marriage as m f . btw the 3 16 guy said that saying the framing of these statistics shouldn t be confined to religion . this is something that is contradicted by the reporter s article . the article highlights that religious people are the ones who are more opposed to 377a and prefer m f marriage definition . but the reporter mostly just nods as if she doesn t want to say that she highlighted that religious people were more opposed in her article . like , why else would the reporter highlight that religious people were more opposed if it religion isn t a main factor ? anyways then they discussed about the safety of queer folks in sg . generally the director and pd rep said that there s a lot of emotional and psychological damage , and not so much of physical although there is some in the form of getting kicked out of the house for example . 3 16 guy s response was that there are were cases of people having different ideas about queerness who were discriminated . he said i had one guy who was accused of being homophobic despite not being homophobic , and he was bullied . he also had one other example relating to work but it s similar in nature to his point . i mostly agree with the director and pd rep . 3 16 rep was basically pulling the old i m actually the victim card . christians and muslim make up like more than 30 of the population 2020 singstat , while queer people only make up like 12 2022 ipsos as i ve mentioned it s usually religious people who are highlighted as the opposition to queer rights , so i feel that he is wrong to try and play the victim here . the predominant culture has been to suppress queers . this guy even talked about the police raids on gay scenes many years ago . this 12 is the weaker community , whilst the 30 have the numbers and a long standing culture of heteronormativity in the country . is bullying anti queer people wrong ? arguably yes , but it s likely much less of an issue than queer bullying . there was a lengthy session about cancel culture , basically everyone say cancelling is wrong and we should talk things out . i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against . like dude , you learnt to suppress your true sexual self . i would feel bad for you if you weren t part of a church that works to convert people into abstinence from their same sex attractions . also , the issue is not about attraction . who you are attracted to could largely be kept secret . it is hard to discriminate by who youre attracted to . it is , however , easy to discriminate against people who act on those attractions because they are engaging in a physical act that can be caught seen by other people . don t equivocate attraction with the issue being discussed , which is about expressing thoughts and ideas . it s not the same topic and isn t relevant . another thought is that i wish that the pd rep talked about how cancel culture is something that is not just done by the left , it s also done by the right . if i come out to my conservative christian extended family , they aren t going to just agree to disagree they ll call me a sinner and likely ask me to go for conversion therapy or repent . that is cancel culture too . i expressed my thoughts and got shamed , and was silenced and asked to reform . tbc edit some spelling and grammar fixes . lack of brainpower to fix everything",16-11-2022 23:12,Reddit,377a,0

"beyond some book , what exactly is the basis to support the claim the homosexuality is morally wrong ?"," if your argument hinges on fudging the meaning of words and doublespeak , you don t have a very good one . sorry , but the term normal is used informally very often for a reason . you not understanding that isn t my problem . in a sense yes , being non chinese is not normal because it s not the majority . alternatively it is normal because we expect there to be a significant minority population of non chinese in singapore . yeah , and we expect people to be homosexuals , so it s entirely normal . trying to obfuscate with unquantified terms like significant doesn t change that . do not that estimates place the homosexual population between 4 5 that s more than some of our minority races like the eurasians . are you saying that being a eurasian is abnormal ? you re changing the goalposts . initially you said science tells us that heterosexuality and homosexuality both are equally normal . now you re saying that they re healthy and expected . not the same thing . if you were to access someone who s heterosexual or homosexual , you would find that both would fit the criteria for normal physical and or mental health outcomes . so yes , they are both equally healthy and expected in terms of outcomes . there are no facts to support any kind of moral arguments . end of discussion then . why keep wasting my time ? sorry , but i just don t see the point of having a conversation that s not going to be based on facts . it d be like debating someone who s anti vaxx or denies climate change if facts can t convince them , why would i waste time convincing otherwise ? but lgbt is ok because science doesn t say it s morally wrong is a stupid argument , because science doesn t , and can t show that anything is morally wrong . neither can religion ? beyond some book , what exactly is the basis to support the claim the homosexuality is morally wrong ? meanwhile , science has already established that homosexuality is not a disorder or illness and that both homosexuality and heterosexuality are normal aspects of human sexuality . that s the most objective argument you can make to not treat either differently . do you have a similarly substantiated argument to support giving one group less rights ? morals are simply not falsifiable or testable scientific claims . yeah , why are we using morals to decide what rights a group gets ? do note that doing so has resulted in things like slavery , sexism , racism and islamophobia . great idea , right ?

"government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement ."," government considering best way forward on 377a , will respect different viewpoints shanmugam court s decision consistent with past position on 377a mr shanmugam noted that successive court judgments over the years have consistently taken the position that these are highly contentious social issues and within the province of parliament . the heterosexual stable family remains a stable norm , he added . the current legal position reflects our society s norms , values and attitudes . that s what the courts have said . in its judgment , the court noted that the compromise which singapore has struck , in respect to section 377a , is unique , said mr shanmugam . our approach strikes a balance between preserving the legislative status quo , whilst accommodating the concerns of those directly affected by the legislation . the court recognised that the government did this in order to avoid driving a deeper wedge within our society , he added . it also noted that singapore s approach seeks to keep what to do with section 377a within the democratic space . socially charged issues , such as section 377a , call for continued discussion and open ended resolution within the political domain , where we can forge consensus , rather than in win lose outcomes in court . in this way , we can accommodate divergent interests , avoid polarisation and facilitate incremental change , said mr shanmugam . additionally , the court highlighted the importance of creating space for peaceful co existence among various groups , especially since the balance between the various interests around section 377a has grown more delicate . these opinions align with the approach that the government has taken in dealing with section 377a , and that it intends to take as it considers the changes in our social landscape since 2007 . in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong said in parliament , when the penal code was amended but section 377a left unchanged , that we want to be a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society , said mr shanmugam . mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin . this remains our stand today , added mr shanmugam . our emphases on gradual evolution and on traditional families remain constant . shifting attitudes towards homosexuality however , since the issue was last discussed in parliament in 2007 , social attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted , mr shanmugam acknowledged . one of the things that upsets the lgbt community is that many feel that their experience of being hurt or rejected by their families , friends , schools , companies is not recognised , indeed often denied . at the same time , a large majority want to preserve the overall tone of our society , said mr shanmugam . in particular , the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman , and that children should be raised within such a family structure . their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family . many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men . both these viewpoints are valid and important , he added . live and let live approach noting that these are deeply divisive issues , mr shanmugam said that is why the government takes a live and let live approach . we seek to be an inclusive society , where mutual respect and tolerance for different views and practices are paramount . government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement . and agc takes a similar approach . mr shanmugam added that the government had expressly included in the mrha maintenance of religious harmony act that any attack on lgbt groups , or on persons because they are lgbt , will be an offence , and won t be tolerated . lgbt individuals are entitled to live peacefully , without being attacked or threatened , he said . likewise , any attack on any other group , based on their religion , or religious beliefs , even if those beliefs run counter to values held by lgbt groups will not be acceptable . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",03-03-2022 16:08,Reddit,377a,0

why have you let the boys live ? the midwives answered pharaoh , hebrew women are not like egyptian women they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive . so god was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous . and because the midwives feared god , he gave them families of their own . . please point out to me the word lie or deceive in the passage , or anything remotely related to those words . from what i can gather , they openly disobeyed pharaoh , which has nothing to do with lying or deceit . but you are replying to another commenter to criticise him , so obviously the context of his comment also matters . congratulations , you just played yourself again . you are precisely right in saying that the context of his comment matters , and the context of the word homosexual in his comment is referring to the sexual orientation , not the act . yet you continually try to pursue the lie that the in the context we are discussing , it refers to an adjective describing the nature of an action . agreed , but removeddit a source not controlled by me clearly shows that op never said anything about why would a man want to look at another man when he has the same body parts . go ahead and see for yourself . removeddit doesn t show edited comments . and i indeed have proof that the question was asked , as you responded to it in this post https www . reddit . com r singapore comments lnd00t student pleads guilty to molesting schoolmate go3tcb8 ?

the figure is something close to 100 turning out trans if gender dysphoria persists or worsens after puberty .," i think children s brains are not fully developed that they should be allowed to make life changing decisions when they are kid teens . i do agree with this , which is why doctors and psychs who specialise in treating trans people should be involved , as well as their parents or guardians . more importantly , if a child has reached the point of even being considered for medical intervention it is long and tedious to get there , the odds are highly in favour of them being trans . in that situation , not intervening would be the major life changing decision that s much more likely to have lifelong negative effects . the figure is something close to 100 turning out trans if gender dysphoria persists or worsens after puberty . while there s still the slim possibility that they may not grow up to be trans , if there s a 90 likelihood that they will , then the safest , default course of action would actually be transition . even among the remaining 10 , for them to reach that point would mean they are very gender non conforming . any mistaken medical interventions would thus not have the same impact on them as it would for some random kid . a butch lesbian is less likely to be bothered by having a deeper voice or smaller breasts compared to if it were a super girly girl , for example . i remember reading a study that briefly mentioned some of those youths who were on puberty blockers but eventually decided not to transition , and they did not regret it , especially because the experience proved to them that their parents genuinely cared about their thoughts and what they wanted for their own lives , rather than dictating what they should do .

the same goes for kids who express a trans identity .,"if youths under 18 are not yet mature enough to know their gender identity which may well be the case , then the truly moral thing to do would be to put every child on puberty blockers until they re old enough to consent to any irreversible changes via gonads or external medication done to their body . in most cases though , gender identity forms around age 4 , and solidifies around the start of puberty at age 12 or so , after which it is extremely unlikely to change . this has nothing to do with the ability to understand sex . most kindergarten age kids can tell you if they re a girl or boy , and that shouldn t be taken as proof that they are sexually mature . the same goes for kids who express a trans identity . if they re really young , this could still change , but not by the point when puberty has started and they re increasingly distressed at their physical masculinization or feminization . prolonging the suffering won t make them change their mind .

"besides the usual homophobic nonsense that homosexuality was an unnatural product of sin because god made adam and eve to reproduce despite homosexuality being common not only throughout human history amongst many cultures but in other animal species , he also was a young earth creationist .","oof . . . this kind of fear mongering and homophobia hits close to me . i used to go to a christian youth group in woodlands when i was in my teens and my youth leader also preached a lot of conspiracies that sadly , i believed at the time . besides the usual homophobic nonsense that homosexuality was an unnatural product of sin because god made adam and eve to reproduce despite homosexuality being common not only throughout human history amongst many cultures but in other animal species , he also was a young earth creationist . in short , they read the genealogy in various chapters of the bible literally and calculate it to determine that the earth is only around 6000 years old . as such , they also believe that scientists fake carbon dating evidence that the earth is 4 . 6 billions years ago , that fossils are a product of noah s flood , that macro evolution is another science satanist conspiracy , and of course that dinosaurs lived amongst humans . citing the leviathian in job is a popular example , though most modern bible scholars agree its a mythical sea serpent used a literary device to show god s strength and isn t a real creature . he screened the debate between bill nye and ken ham being on the latter s side ofc , and scheduled bible studies where the focus was on young earth creationism . because i was a dumb lonely teen who wanted approval i bought all of it and got super into creationism , and he even bought me some extra books to do further readings in . thankfully i was able to leave the echo chamber when my family migrated for a year , and the time was enough to realise he been feeding me bullshit . the church i went to in my new country was much more mainstream and i realised that science didn t go against the bible and there was no real conspiracy against christians . i still went back to the youth group after i returned to sg but the spell was broken and i increasingly couldn t accept the lack of logic in his arguments . they were all centred around the idea that christians are this poor victimised group and that we are doing the world tainted by satan this great service by preaching to them and changing them from their sinful ways , sinful meaning anything that was non christian other religions , lgbt , sex before marriage , abortion , etc . ultimately i couldn t accept that morality would be based on one s belief or lack of in a specific deity rather than on ethical principles , and that good non christians would be damned in hell but bad christians could still get into heaven . i also felt that the group i was in were awfully similar to the pharisees in the bible more concerned about the literal letter of biblical law than its spirit , of being kind and loving one s neighbor . i did leave the group , and sadly in the process also lost my faith . i know most christians aren t that radical , but i felt hurt by the way i had been indoctrinated and didn t want to leave anything based on faith alone anymore . i m an agnostic now . tldr if you find being in a religion gives your comfort and helps you be a better person , more power to you . but don t twist religious superstition to scare people into supporting your faith , demonizing minority groups who just want to live their own lives in peace . is it a coincidence that the pride flag has 6 colours ? . . . i mean yes , so does south africa and i don t think you would say they are under satan s influence right ",24-07-2020 15:01,Reddit,homosexuality,-1

"also , if the 377a is repealed , the next step is to legalize gay marriage .","1 . yes , op didn t ask for acceptance from every person . however op did talked about the general acceptance of the alt lifestyle as also another normal , from both the workforce and family before moving onto the equality part . quote while 377a is not strictly enforced , it is still in place to preserve traditional family values . we want acceptance from our parents and not have the fear of getting kicked out of the house . we have to be recognised as husbands wives without having the fear that our sexuality will affect our career especially for those in the govt sector . unquote in the last quoted sentence , op seem to imply that the legal effect of gay marriage law will eliminate the fear of their sexuality affecting their career . it is simply not true . stigma can happen in very subtle ways , even if the gay marriage is legal on paper . 2 . op did mention about education . quote and it sucks because of the lack of education about sexuality in singapore . no teachers or adults ever talked about it . unquote there seem to be a suggested frustration towards our current curriculum not being accepting other genders hence it is unable to help confused youngsters come to terms with their ssa . also , if the 377a is repealed , the next step is to legalize gay marriage . absolutely right because it is naturally the next step . now if you have already legalize the act between same sex as well as marriage , shouldn t you also be teaching about the different genders in school as part of sex ed ? how can you accept gay marriage but not change sex ed ? isn t that tantamount to discrimination , no ? on the law level you accept other genders , but in school you don t ? does that make sense ? wouldn t not changing sex ed to accommodate other genders be equivalent to being homophobic ? this is the line of thought . am i jumping the gun ? nope because that s how it was done in the west . it is not logical to only stop at gay marriage . it is the natural road of progression . to say you accept same sex union without changing school curriculum to educate the younger singaporeans on other genders is almost like you look into the mirror , only to forget how you look like after you walk away . 3 . op was using a bible verse to justify how if we love someone , we should accept them as who they are , to which i quoted another bible verse that said about correcting someone whom you love . i was just trying to put that neighbor love into context . that love also includes loving discipline . nothing about correcting anybody . like how a mother would correct a wayward son not because she hates him , but because she loved him . love does not equate full acceptance was the point i was trying to bring up . 4 . well it clearly make difference when it comes to acquiring hdbs and marriage etc . but since op was on the topic of acceptance , it does not make a difference because stigma will still be there anyways . so we repeal 377a ? coz it helps them get hdbs and a proper marriage license ? sounds good . but again , what about point 2 ? it doesn t just stop there . it is not logical . as i have brought up about the gender less toilet in my earlier post , that is also a part of the logical progression . since there are more than just two genders , how can we discriminate the other genders by only having just two gendered toilets ? if the school teaches about multiple genders , why aren t the toilets showing more than two genders ? it happened in the us and children got sexually assaulted by men identifying as female in toilets . all of these will eventually intrude into the lives of the majority because it affects everyone . and you cannot impose the preference of the minorities at the expense of the majority . as for the issue on hdb , well it can be resolved by renting an apartment outside , until you reach the age of 35 . there s no systematic oppression in singapore . homosexuals have their safe space here . they don t get sentenced to jail just for being homosexuals like in the middle east . they get to host pink dot every year without police arresting them and government stopping the event . so things are fine as they are . hence , for the reasons mentioned above , i support 377a . its more than just hdbs and marriage acceptance or even society acceptance . i genuinely hope everyone here at the very least do their own research and look into what happened after gay marriage was passed in other countries . look into facts . not those sensational headlines . if after looking into all of that , you still disagree with me , thats fine with me . really . all i just hope is that everyone arrive at their stand through evidences , facts and logic instead of emotions .

transgender children desistance a5caf61fc5c6 wrt . dsm 5 . if you include kids who are gender non conforming but don t have a different gender identity , it s likely going to inflate the any desistance numbers . he also included both children without any developed secondary sex characteristics and adolescents who do have some characteristics and are more certain if they want them . from steensma 2011 https sci hub . do https pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov 21216800 the actual physical changes during puberty usually resulted in hatred of and disgust with their bodies . . . as a result of the increased aversion towards their bodies , the girls became insecure with themselves . . . especially the actual physical changes made both boys and girls feel obstructed in their lives , and resulted in a strong desire for medical treatment e . g . , puberty blocking hormones , cross sex hormones , and surgery . this is me editorializing , but the 2013 steensma study wanted to include both trans kids and kids likely to be mistaken for trans kids . he deliberately included sub threshold gd kids and included two questionnaires that had high sensitivity and specificity in that sample adolescents reports of gd and body image were compared across persisters and desisters , and showed that persisters reported more gd than desisters in the mean total scores of both the giiaa and the ugds . clinically , for the giiaa , scores of less than 3 indicate gd 87 . 2 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 0 of the desisters . for the ugds , scores of more than 40 . 0 indicate gd 97 . 9 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 2 . 2 of the desisters 1 bisexual , natal girl . if he was just looking for trans people , he might as well just have stuck with the ugds . he clarifies in this interview https www . kqed . org futureofyou 441784 the controversial research on desistance in transgender youth that the purpose of the study was to find variables that could act as predictors of persistence , not whether currently existing tools can identify trans kids , so it would make sense that he d want both persisters and desisters in his original sample . we re talking about sexual maturity that only triggers on the onset of puberty . we re not , we re talking about gender identity , that the blaunchedcauli correctly said that as far as we know starts being expressed by about age 3 . it is undeniable that puberty causes an immense change in our psychology . to stop a child s psychological development for the sake of a political agenda is child abuse . that s not stopping the development of psychology for the sake of a political agenda . if you think that either testosterone or estrogen are necessary for psychological development then we should be administering that earlier , not later . i ve not seen any negative studies on kids starting puberty at 16 the age of medical consent in the uk and some us states as opposed younger endogenous puberty timings . it s also for the sake of preventing the development of secondary sex characteristics the kids don t want , idk what the political agenda is . 2 . there are medically advised age limits for medications for children with such disorders . . . they re an estimate to do the greatest good . okay so it kind of just looks like you re unaware of what current standards of care for trans kids are . this is based on what i understand to be the current standards of care known as the dutch protocol https www . researchgate . net publication 51768297 treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria in the netherlands . the adolescent should have reached tanner stage 2 to 3 and be older than 12 years of age . starting around tanner stages 2 to 3 , the very rst physical changes are still reversible . some experience with one s physical puberty is required because the authors assume that experiencing one s own puberty is diagnostically useful . it is at the onset of puberty that it becomes clear whether the gender dysphoria will desist or persist puberty blockers pb are only administered after a child has already undergone some pubertal changes , and even then they only delay puberty , where stopping pbs continue endogenous puberty . cross sex hormones are generally only administered at 16 again the medical age of consent in some major countries . we don t have to resort to hypothetical trans kids making a heavy decision , we already have empirical data on whether kids can make this decision in conjunction with a team of doctors and their parents . there are more studies on trans youth than these , but two i m aware of are this dutch study https sci hub . do https www . jsm . jsexmed . org article s1743 6095 18 30057 2 fulltext sec3 . 3 that looked at kids from 1972 2015 and found that only 1 . 9 decided to stop puberty blockers after starting though if i remember correctly they have no figures on anyone who wanted to transition again later and this retrospective study https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc7073269 that found higher suicidal ideation in those who wanted but could not get pb than those that managed to get pb . 3 . . . . why the fuck are we green lighting a condition that is even less well understood especially in the long term and fraught with political motivations ? see , i do not get what political motivations means . my first instinct is to be glib and say the imh assuming the account is accurate was providing care according to current best practices https www . wpath . org media cms documents soc 20v7

it is in our nation s interest to procreate and maintain its own working population . 90 of sgreans live in public housing renters are by and large foreigners , no ? unless you have some source which you can share that im unaware of . my response within my own circle , i do hear a number of sgreans renting public housing , so i do not agree that renters are by and large foreigners . sadly . some reasons includes family problems or no access to credit . to add on i think singles , heterosexual couples , and lgbt couples should all be able to bto . 2 4rm bto , everyone regardless of whether you are single , married , heterosexual or etc needs affordable housing . my response to who need it most . i doubt the lgbt fight overseas actually includes housing as an issue so i presume this is unique to singapore due to lack of land . most likely they will just use one room as their bedroom . proportionating of financial gains subsidized by the govt be part of the consideration , but rather renting is one of the biggest poverty traps , which i . the cost of providing housing is much much cheaper than having to solve the issues from the lack thereof public housing . my response this statement i don t think is correct . if you look at purely the the cost of construction of the house , well it is cheap . but if you look at i would much rather have people be able to self sustain , rather than falling down the poverty cycle and eventually needing to live off the government , which will be much more expensive to the tax payer in the long run my response agree with your statement on self sustainability . nevertheless lgbt and singles does not need to maintain a family nucleus so i don t think they have equal opportunities to housing click to expand . . . my response within my own circle , i do hear a number of sgreans renting public housing , so i do not agree that public housing renters are by and large foreigners this is an opinion , not a factual statement ? how does that prove that most renters are singaporeans ? nevertheless regardless of whether renters are singaporeans or foreigners , you mentioned your main concern is housing prices to finance retirement . but in the first place , housing isnt the primary source to financing retirement . saving , investing and cpf are the three key pillars of retirement for singaporeans . furthermore , singaporeans have low cpf savings and are unable to receive a good payout from cpf life which is the best retirement plan as it is a life long annuity , the root cause of low cpf savings is because singaporeans overspend their oa on property , because housing itself is unaffordable , so shouldnt the government ensure everyone has access to low cost housing bto in non mature estates so they can retire ? wanting to keep property values high is completely contradictory to helping the average singporean especially those who are currently young to retire . to who need it most . should childless couples be able to get 4 room flats and above then ? what if they never procreate ? most likely they will just use one room as their bedroom . proportionating of financial gains subsidized by the govt be part of the consideration , but rather frankly , i think the size is not the issue . since the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . since you think that lgbt singles do not deserve 4 room flats , do you think they should be able to purchase 2 3 room housing which is lesser in space so they can live with a roof over their head ? i would also like to understand more , why do you think childless couples are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples ? my response this statement i don t think is correct . if you look at purely the the cost of construction of the house , well it is cheap . but if you look at the cost of construction , housing is borne by the couples who pay for the flat , im not suggesting anyone receive free housing . the amenities , infrastructure of an estate is not only consumed by one single or one lgbt couple , but rather shared by the entire neighborhood . furthermore regardless of where a person lives , a single or lgbt couple would still consume infrastructure and amenities . furthermore if one does not have access to housing they are more likely to be a burden on the taxpayer through the use of social programs , healthcare etc . i think it is rather easy to see that elevating a person to being a productive member of society by allowing them to be able to afford a roof over their head and being able to contribute to society since they have a stable safety net is much better than them being reliant on handouts when they are stuck in poverty . can you clarify your stance , if singles and lgbt couples do not have housing , what do you think is the solution if not providing btos before 35 even if its just 2 or 3 room flats ?

"these matters faced wide spread and broad lack of popularity , far more than the worst case scenario of every single christian and catholic being a single issue voter who would vote out the government for voting in 377a ."," true we are not single issue voters , but you want to appeal as much as possible to broader audiences . i think this goes back to my earlier point about the reserved presidency , casinos , and even the fake news bill as it was passed . these matters faced wide spread and broad lack of popularity , far more than the worst case scenario of every single christian and catholic being a single issue voter who would vote out the government for voting in 377a . the fact that despite this , we still have casinos , the current president , and the fake news bill , suggests to me that the pap well knows that singaporeans are not single issue voters . consequently the entire political necessity argument stands on shaky legs . history has shown that singaporeans are willing to stomach deeply unpopular issues so long as the government overall is seen to be doing good . unless something drastically changes , the stance for political correctness seems to be not addressing the elephant in the room . which is why in my first post above i mentioned that if we do become a more secular nation , repealing 377a would be the main talking point to appear more progressive . i find the use of political correctness here rather curious , because if you accept that the existence of 377a is not a morally neutral position , and that gay men lack the same ability to legally have anal intercourse , then it follows that 377a is an issue that goes well beyond the window dress of political correctness . it has substantive impact of gay men in singapore a point directly acknowledged by the court of appeal . calling this issue as a a matter of political correctness , fails to account for the substantive effect of 377a . haha i like to think that the imagine part of the sentence whoever compasses , imagines , invents , devises , or intends the death is just legal trying to cover all bases , however silly it may seem in foresight . the word imagine is only used in this manner in relation to the president , and not other crime . it s there intentionally , and not simply legally trying to cover all bases . it literally creates a thought crime . my point in referring to s121a is to draw a direct contrast to crimes that truly are unenforceable . 377a is currently enforced simply because the present government and ag says so . these positions can change in the future , and unlike the thought crime of s121a , there is no technical or theoretical problems with enforcing 377a . it has been enforced in the past , and if the government changes its mind , it can be enforced in the future . the very question i ask myself when they banned a certain band from performing in singapore . the thing about political landscapes is that organised entities always have more negotiating power . they can collectively drop support for a single politician , because they stand together . again , i find this reasoning suspect . in order for this to be a substantive worry , these are the things that would have to happen i christians and catholics vote as a united bloc ii christians and catholics are all single issue voters on and that issue is the repeal of 377a iii christians and catholics are equally distributed across all grcs in the country for maximum effect and iv christians and catholics are willing to vote for the other party , solely based on this single issue . my view is that the more likely scenario is that our government is not as secular as it professes , and that within the government , there is an over representation of christians who are unable to separate their personal religious view on lgbt issues , and the question of whether as a secular nation such matters should be in the law . this explanation is far more likely than the phantom fear of the existence of a large single issue christian voting bloc .

"sin and crime the national council of churches of singapore , the catholic archbishop , and the islamic authorities have issued statements against the repeal of section 377a .","singapore was part of the british empire . it was once administered by the british from calcutta kolkata . many of our laws , including the penal code , were imported from india . the indian penal code , in section 377 , criminalises carnal intercourse against the order of nature . sodomy was considered a crime under section 377 . section 377a of the singapore penal code makes it a crime for two consenting male adults to have sex with each other in private . it does not penalise sex between two consenting female adults . the first question is whether section 377a should be repealed . the second question is whether 377a is consistent with our constitution . the scientific evidence singaporeans are a rational people . we make our policies and laws based on facts , science and reason . what is the scientific evidence on homosexuality ? is it a form of mental disorder which can be cured ? or is it a normal aspect of human sexuality ? in 1973 , the world health organisation who deleted homosexuality from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders . this decision was endorsed by the general assembly of who in 1990 when it agreed to delete homosexuality from the list of mental disorders . in who s view , being lgbt lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender is not a disease . scientists do not know what determines a person s sexual orientation , but they theorise that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic , hormonal and environmental influences and do not view it as a choice . they favour biologically based theories , which point to genetic factors . scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in itself a source of negative psychological effects . scientists also believe that there is insufficient evidence to support psychological interventions to change sexual orientation . sodomy and the world the united nations has 196 member states . the majority , 124 states , do not criminalise sodomy . however , the minority of 72 states , including singapore , do . which societies belong to the majority ? all the countries of europe , north america and south america do not criminalise sodomy . it is of interest to point out that china , japan , south korea , hong kong , taiwan , the philippines and thailand also belong to the majority . it is therefore not the case of a liberal west versus a conservative east . which countries make up the 72 which criminalise sodomy ? they are the arab countries , the muslim majority countries and , surprisingly , the former british colonies of asia , africa and the caribbean . singapore is part of the minority mainly because it inherited from the british a penal code which criminalises sodomy . for a country which embraces science and technology , it is surprising that , on this one aspect , the law has not been updated , in the light of the scientific evidence . sin and crime the national council of churches of singapore , the catholic archbishop , and the islamic authorities have issued statements against the repeal of section 377a . they regard homosexuality as a violation of their religious dogmas and therefore a sin . my good friend , former attorney general walter woon , has pointed out that there is a fundamental difference a sin and a crime . he said that many regard adultery and fornication as sinful but these are not criminal behaviour . he concluded that sodomy may be a sin but it should not be made a crime . he is also unhappy with the compromise of retaining 377a and not enforcing it because it brings the law into disrepute . there is an important point which i wish to make to the christian and islamic authorities . i would respectfully remind them that singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian country or a muslim country . it is not the business of the state to enforce the dogmas of those religions . in singapore , there is a separation between religion and the state . church leaders and islamic leaders should respect that separation . role of courts in most cases , the antiquated sodomy laws were repealed by the legislatures of the respective states or countries . however , in a few cases , the laws were declared unconstitutional by the courts . in 1960 , every state of the united states had a law criminalising sodomy . by 2003 , only 14 states , including texas , had such laws . in 2003 , the united states supreme court made a landmark decision in lawrence v texas . the court held , by a majority of six to three , that the texas law criminalising sodomy was unconstitutional . speaking for the majority , justice anthony kennedy said the petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives . the state cannot demean or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime . the ruling in effect invalidated anti sodomy law in the other 13 states as well . but today , 15 years later , most of these states have not repealed the anti sodomy law . however , it is considered unenforceable as the supreme court has ruled it unconstitutional . in september 2018 , the indian supreme court overturned its earlier decision of 2013 , and ruled that section 377 of the indian code was unconstitutional . this was the unanimous decision of a panel of five judges . chief justice dipak misra said that criminalising homosexual sex is irrational , arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional . another judge , indu malhotra , said history owes an apology to the lgbt people for ostracising them . in 2014 , the issue of the constitutionality of section 377a was considered by the court of appeal in the case of lim meng suang v attorney general . the court ruled that the law was not unconstitutional . i believe that the court s judgment was wrong . i hope that the court of appeal will overturn its 2014 decision if it is presented with an opportunity to do so . i will conclude with the following four propositions . first , the scientific evidence is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality . it is not a mental disorder . second , section 377a is an antiquated law , not supported by science , and should be repealed . third , singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian or muslim country . the leaders of those religions should respect the separation of state and religion and refrain from pressuring the government to criminalise conduct which they consider sinful . fourth , the court of appeal should overturn its 2014 decision and declare 377a to be unconstitutional . veteran diplomat tommy koh is chairman of the centre for international law and rector of tembusu college , both at the national university of singapore .

it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not .,"when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021

"also , to have all those , you will need to get a referral to a psychiatrist who needs to diagnose you with gender dysphoria .","just in case you are being serious , what you have proposed is not something that is possible in singapore also identifying as a transsexual ? what do you mean by that ? to be excused from ns , you usually require a doctor s letter and be on hormones for at least a year . this is extremely difficult before 21 because you need parental permission to start hormones during 18 21 . hormones will not be prescribed before 18 . also , to have all those , you will need to get a referral to a psychiatrist who needs to diagnose you with gender dysphoria . followed by being seen by an endocrinologist who will also make sure that you really need the hormones . there are not that many trans people who destransition so i cannot say if doing so will lead to you being called back for ns . identity myself as a man get married to a self identified woman and qualify for hdb grant ? you won t be able to do so unless she has undergone srs to change her legal gender marker while you have not done so . which is an increased difficulty for trans people because your choice of partner can lead to srs being necessary or prohibited to be married doing srs after marriage will likely cause the marriage to be annulled by rom . can a male athete self identify as a woman , join the olympics games and win the gold medal and come back and get the 1 million dollars promised by pap you can try . but you need to declare their gender and not change that assertion for four years , as well as demonstrate a testosterone level of less than 10 nanomoles per liter for at least one year prior to competition and throughout the period of eligibility . that will definitely affect your strength and possibly change parts of your body permanently . so i hope you will enjoy your new breasts and lowered strength if you do so also possibly weakened bones and maybe loss of fertility .

"looks at the countries which decriminalised homosexuality and the ones which haven t nah i think we re gonna be okay apparently , lgbt inclusion and economic development are mutually reinforcing too https www ."," in a media statement released after ndr 2022 , apccs chairman reverend yang tuck yong said , the repeal is an extremely regrettable decision which will have a profound impact on the culture that our children and future generations of singaporeans will live in . looks at the countries which decriminalised homosexuality and the ones which haven t nah i think we re gonna be okay apparently , lgbt inclusion and economic development are mutually reinforcing too https www . sciencedirect . com science article pii s0305750x19300695 however , we also recognise that the government seeks to bring about a balance among many differing viewpoints on this matter . we strongly urge the government to entrench the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman in the singapore constitution . that would be the most prudent way forward . i really really don t understand this view point . i really really don t . please explain to me why your view point should be held to the same level of importance when it reinforces the current discrimination and withholding of human rights to people ? to me , i think this has a similar level of absurdity to the abortion debate , but perhaps even more ridiculous . both issues are individual issues for the lack of a better word , as in no third party rights are lost when pregnant people have an abortion or when lgbt individuals have equal rights . maybe for abortion i can see why people would be upset and think its murder or something , but equal rights for the lgbt community ? come on . in a statement on its website , the church added , however , we seek protection of the family and marriage according to natural law and our rights to teach and practise them unhindered . we must not allow reverse discrimination to take place against those who believe in marriage as defined between a man and a woman . reverse discrimination ? ? ? ive seen this being thrown around so many times but it never fails to crack me up at rhe insanity of it . pray tell , what exactly are they being discriminated against ? i havent been told a single reason everytime i ask this question , because there simply is no reason having equal rights doesnt mean that these people who are against lgbtq suddenly cannot be against lgbtq anymore or are forced to support them . they still can . its js that maybe you cant openly say anti lgbtq stuff if an lgbtq anti discrimination law is passed , which would be similar to anti discrimination laws for race lgbtq people aren t forcing religious institutions to wed them or forcing the government to give them affirmative action . all we want is just to be treated like cishet people and have equal rights when it comes to healthcare , housing , marriage , etc of which , id argue that healthcare and housing are also human rights taking comfort in the government s plan to enshrine the definition of marriage in the constitution , it added , otherwise , we will be taking a slippery road of no return , weakening the fabric of a strong society which is founded on the bedrock of holistic families and marriages . slippery road of no return ? ? looks at the countries which have already legalised same sex marriage nah i think we ll be fine also what on earth is a strong society ? to me , it s one that is resilient and can work together to overcome challenges . i don t think you can do that very well if there s still a proportion of the population who doesn t have equal rights some of them i would think are also human rights holistic families and marriages huh . holistic is the idea of comprehensiveness . completeness . which is ironic because i think a society which is accepting and supportive of lgbtq individuals is closer to that than whatever we have now lgbtq people are part of families too . if we celebrate families without celebrating the lgbtq people who are in these families , that s not very comprehensive , is it ? and the idea of lgbt families being not holistic , or in other words , not complete is very strange to me . what are they missing ? love ? trust ? happiness ? i don t know ",22-08-2022 07:04,Reddit,homosexuality,0

"377a does little to nothing to prevent the spread of stds , gay or otherwise .","most people would see the repeal of 377a as the first step to allow gay couples to marry have civil unions . from that , they could potentially be allowed to be legally recognized as nok , apply for hdb before 35 years old , adopt surrogate children , amongst other things . these are some privileges of life that others take for granted . some would mention that gays pay taxes too , and should get whatever the straights can . what some people are afraid of is the supposed moral and birthrate decline that s going to happen if 377a disappears . personally , i don t see how that should even be a point . more realistic fears are that religious bodies private companies are expected to endorse condone future marriages religious bakers got into trouble by rejecting to bake a cake for gays in the us . i don t expect this to happen here , seeing that organizations businesses rightfully should have the right to refuse clients . other fears include all toilets magically being converted to allow any genders to use and therefore more prone to sexual assault , and the use of hormone puberty blockers on children i m a little impartial on this . as for your mention of stds , the only way of curbing it is through sex ed . people need to know how to protect themselves during intercourse . that can come with or without 377a being repealed , although i d argue it s easier if it is repealed . as of now , schools in singapore do provide some sex ed teaching the use of condoms , at least , but as far as i recall , teachers are made to keep the topic of homosexuality hush hush or in a negative light , which may not help a young horny gay boy with questions . if the stigma s removed sooner , more thorough and open formal education would come easier . to add on to my point above , in the us , states that are more religious and taught only abstinence in schools have higher teen pregnancy rates . by inference , abstinence only sex ed does less to prevent unprotected sex as compared to a more comprehensive sex ed programme . if a law is supposedly there to prevent the spread of stds , should it not be the case that it criminalizes anyone with stds who have sex ? 377a does little to nothing to prevent the spread of stds , gay or otherwise . either way , if criminalizing an entire population for a subset of its group is singapore s way of handling things , it s just sad .

"edit for those of you interested , here are what some pap mp said about lgbt rights and issues .","people here in this thread are hammering the sdp over a non issue . no opposition party in singapore will address lgbt issues publicly , even if they support them privately . this is the most practical form of politics given that public support will alienate a huge majority of their support given singapore s largely conservative population , especially among the older generation , when support for them is already hard to come by in the first place . we have to realise that things like this takes time , and it would be unwise for any opposition parties to lose any political capital before they even get elected into parliament . what is the point of anyone coming out and say oh 377a should be repealed , but never get elected into parliament ? as usual , redditors think too highly of themselves if they feel that opposition parties should ignore all practicalities and just support lgbt issues without considering the full political climate of the country . if there is any party you really want to blame , you can thank the incumbent for singapore s current stance against lgbt . they are the party with the most political capital to expend , and can be the only party said to hold on to their bases and not immediately lose power even if they support lgbt . but guess what , they are not going to be doing that anything soon , with a few mps like christopher de souza even coming out publicly to reject lgbt rights . edit for those of you interested , here are what some pap mp said about lgbt rights and issues . you can decide the rest for yourself . christopher de souza the last consequence of a repeal of section 377a is its effect on how we may have to educate our children . it flows that with changes in how marriage , the family nucleus and spousal rights are defined , there will be pressure to change our curricula in our schools . do we want to see our children being taught that homosexuality is an acceptable lifestyle choice ? this is something that we should all think carefully about . zaqy mohamad in my view , the government s status quo stand on homosexual activities under section 377a is for the benefit of society as a whole . the fact is , even though our country is open and receptive to changes and diversity , our society s majority view is still conservative in many aspects of life . . . . . . from a secular point of view , it is something personal and i feel that it is good to leave it as such . but many of my constituents and community leaders have given feedback that by making the activity not considered as an offence , it can be seen as an endorsement or support and this will divide society . they believe that the government will make the appropriate decision that will reflect our social situation in singapore indranee rajah in this case , the public reaction has shown that the majority of singaporeans do not agree with or accept homosexual behaviour . i think it will be fair to say that most singaporeans do not want to see somebody jailed for homosexual practices , but most would definitely not want to see any public demonstration of the conduct . they may be prepared to tolerate it if it is done in private , but they do not wish to see it in public and , very importantly , they do not wish to have their children see it in public . then , of course , the argument comes , ok , fine , if we do not do it in public , what if we just do it in private ? and that is where the signalling concern comes in , because people are concerned about the impact that a repeal of section 377a would send .

if so , please explain to me how teaching catholics to love , accept , do not judge lgbt people constitutes bigotry intolerance ? my point is that the rest of the silent majority of christians aren t any better if they allow themselves to be represented this way . this is exactly what i m opposed to . you are spreading misinformation and falsehoods , saying that all christians allow themselves to be represented by what lawrence khong teaches . that is a blatant lie and you need to stop stirring shit . there is a fundamental difference between what lawrence khong teaches and what the catholic church teaches regarding lgbt , and they by no means represent each other at all . i don t know about what the angelican church teaches , but as far as i know , they have not participated in any active discrimination against lgbt people here , nor have they stirred up any dissent like what lawrence khong has done . it is because of people like you that i have to always explain to any new lgbt person i meet that just because i m catholic , it does not mean i am prejudiced against them , and i have nothing to do with conversion therapy or the wear white movement , that my church s stance on lgbt is to be loving and accepting and not judge or discriminate . i m sure a lot of christians face similar problems , and by propagating these falsehoods you are only serving to cause dissent between the lgbt community and christians who are actually loving and accepting , and cause unnecessary anxiety to both the lgbt and majority of the christian community here .

homosexuals realise they re homosexual because they resonate with homosexual romance more than heterosexual romance .,"i hope psychologists chime in on this matter . people are often quick to assume that criminals do evil because of some triggering cause and proceed to ban it , solving nothing , but in truth it s the opposite . people have natural inclinations which drives them to gravitate towards media of that type . it s a part of everyone s self discovery growing up . homosexuals realise they re homosexual because they resonate with homosexual romance more than heterosexual romance . people watch martial arts and realise they have a deep seated interest in it . and the same goes for negative things . violent people seek out violent games , and perverse people seek out perverse media . does it create them ? no , they seek it because they were naturally inclined to it and banning it doesn t mean they no longer exist . that doesn t justify doing crime . it is an individual s and family s responsibility to instil boundaries on what things can be safely explored in fiction and shouldn t be in reality .

you may view yourself as being neutral but the fact is that you do have an interest in making lgbtq citizens miserable with your promotion of conversion therapy and argument against the repeal of 377a .," as a guy , being able to achieve orgasm , also means that some degree of sexual gratification was achieved . let s say a skilful girl was able to give a homosexual guy an orgasm . it might not be as good as homosexual intercourse , but it s not zero . kevin durant publicly offered to drink scarlet johansson s bath water . he hasn t been successful thus far , going by public record . that doesn t mean that he s given up on sex with anyone else . umm . . orgasm does not mean sexual gratification . it is your body s response to stimuli usually at the erogenous regions but you can still orgasm without enjoying it . if i m talking about weed , then it s much easier being an advocate for 377a , than weed . since only one of them runs the risk of a jail term . it is a promise that could easily be revoked for 377a . take note that they had also used other laws to conduct anti gay operation with a recent one being done in 2010 . also , 377a has been reported https sacc . aware . org . sg get involved your stories to prevent male sexual assault victims from speaking up . so it s not even about a law that isn t enforced . but about everything else after . so even overturning the law wouldn t satisfy the lgbtq community . now i can see why those protect s pore people talk about a larger agenda . while the lgbtq movement says it only doesn t want to be treated as criminals . it is the symbol of the discrimination faced by lgbtq people . is equal rights really a larger agenda ? would you be happy to live with the exact same constraints as us ? perhaps you would like to try it and see why lgbtq people are unhappy with the status quo ? racial equality is mentioned in our pledge enshrined in our constitution . yet it obviously hasn t stopped racism . so even if 377a was struck down , societal acceptance might not necessarily follow . but it did result in a huge improvement where we no longer have such severe racial tensions that would have resulted in racial riots . although racism is not fully removed , it is still a huge step from the past . now science can be used to prove if something might be harmful . but i ve yet to heard about scientific experiments , used to show , if something is ethical or not . in fact , i think that making conversion therapy torturous guarantees failure . the idea is has to be about making it pleasurable . else how does one convert ? but i don t think such experiments are allowed , in this day and age . and how do you propose that ? if you are so certain that conversion therapy works , why not do it on yourself . open yourself to the possible trauma that you propose on inflicting on others ? apart from our legacy british penal code . the barriers you mentioned are there , because it has the complicit support of the majority . most people want a traditional nuclear family unit . while the government wants these units to produce more babies , thus the incentives given to do so . untrue . most of the complicit support are just apathy with some vocal groups bringing in bigotry from western influences . if we removed every single neutral voices , there is a bigger argument for the repeal of 377a . it s not all difficulties , without any benefits . the lack of children means that gay households have more disposable spending power . it s the power of the pink dollar , that brought one of the largest annual gay dance parties to sentosa , once upon a time . so you are saying that there are benefits to being discriminated against ? there are childless straight marriages as well . and they benefit given that they can bto whereas a gay couple intending to stay together will have to pay the extremely high price for a resale and be locked out of certain regions too . where is the increased disposable spending power ? also take note that there is discriminatory hiring which results in lgbtq citizens usually being forced to only get low paying jobs . is that a benefit ? and for pink dollar , the companies profit off of it whereas lgbtq people gain nothing from it . following this line , maybe the lgbtq community can strive to make more money . which will improve their lobbying power . money makes everything easier . it s something our policy makers take into account . perhaps if we do not face discrimination during job hunts ? where disclosing that you re lgbtq will not result in an instant rejection or not getting the chance of an interview ? and ultimately , i didn t write our laws . nor do i plan my day , around making the lgbtq community miserable . neither the larger public , who have bread butter issues to stress about . and yet you consistently argue against allowing lgbtq people equal rights . you have spent hours on a work day arguing for something that will make the lgbtq community miserable . you are also not the only one doing this . you may view yourself as being neutral but the fact is that you do have an interest in making lgbtq citizens miserable with your promotion of conversion therapy and argument against the repeal of 377a . how would straight couples appreciate more competition for their btos ? so we straight up don t deserve housing as singapore citizens ? we all pay the same taxes , we all contribute to singapore , we should all get the same rights and chances at btos . there are so many childfree straight couples who get btos . should we then insist that all of them forfeit their housing to couples that have children ? if you truly care about the finite resource of btos , combating flipping of hdbs and preventing people from having more than one house would probably do a lot more than barring lgbtq people from bto . anyway , i m more than happy . to put the issue to a public referendum . because you know that the bigots are still vocal and a huge percentage are apathetic enough to be happy with continuing discrimination . would you be happy if we have a public referendum regarding your rights ? where if enough people vote for it , you get to lose your job , lose your protection against discriminatory hiring firing , lose your housing , lose your ability to be married , and so on ?

"no single gay person is saying there should be a ban on churches and jesus , in the name of homosexuality ."," traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . again , this goes back to the problems of proposing that marriage should be measured by its reproduction potential . let me quote myself again marriage cannot be defined by its reproduction potential . if so , then thousands of heterosexual couples without children should not be allowed to marry . there are also countless heterosexual couples who plan to never have kids . do we ban them from marrying as well ? under the same logic , people who are infertile or above the age of child bearing should not be allowed to marry too , since reproduction is out of the question . also , in singapore s context , malay families traditionally have more children than non malay ones . given your reference , are you suggesting that malay marriages are superior to non malay ones because they are more ordered toward procreation ? you cannot keep redefining marriage to suit your narrative . marriage has never been about reproduction hetero sex is , and even that isn t its only purpose . marriage is about love and commitment between two persons . are you going to suggest that there be a law that bans all sexual activity which does not result in conception ? one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . again , i can bring up countless studies and examples if you wish to know more . countless books have been written by the children of same sex couples . in fact , same sex couples are a lot more involved in parenting . i have never heard of a same sex parent who hasn t read at least one book on parenting . have you read any books on parenting ? my parents have never done that . they probably don t even know books on parenting exist . are you saying my family did not provide the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of me ? because that s what you re saying . it imposes its acceptance on all society . this is a common fear among those who oppose equality , so i d like to bring some attention to it . no , it doesn t impose anything on you or me , for that matter . even when same sex marriage is legal , i will still find it icky . i will still let my sons know that pussies are more fun not sure what i ll do with daughters , honestly . legalizing it does not force you to accept it . if you have a problem with it , you can still express it . you can still preach against it in churches and mosques . you can stop your children from having gay friends or friends with gay parents , and you can still tell them how immoral and wrong it is . you can even refuse to make wedding cakes or take wedding photos for them . there is pretty much nothing you need to do to accept same sex marriages . by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . on the same stroke , by banning same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active discriminator . by banning same sex marriage , the state is saying these people are less of a human because marriage is for normal human beings only . should the state be able to do that ? should we allow the state to determine that a gay person is less of a human ? . . . punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . sorry to break your bubble , but this part of the article does not apply to singapore . we already have anti discriminatory laws at the work place . state employees who expresses beyond just personal disapproval will already be punished . same for expressions against gender , race , and religion . try going to your work place and announce i do not want to work with these women because women are stupid and see what happens . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences . . . i am not a christian . i am a straight man who believes , strongly , about equality and the benefits of a more equitable society . are you saying i am not a person of good will ? because that s what you re saying . are you saying i m betraying my conscience ? because that s what you re saying . also , if you do not want others to attack your christian morality , why do you , then , insist on attacking our non christian morality ? why do you expect homosexuals to betray their conscience ? why do you want to silence them ? gays are not forcing christians to stop practicing and believing in their faiths . no single gay person is saying there should be a ban on churches and jesus , in the name of homosexuality . why are you trying to impose your belief on others by using the law , in the name of christianity ? this , in essence , is the complete immorality of your position , which brings me to the point about your religion it offends god first , let me just ask the rhetorical question how do you know ? are you god ? second , as an atheist , and millions like me , and millions more who are non christians , we reject your god , either in its meaning , its existence , or both . you may not impose it on us with the law , because the law does not belong to you . but that s the beauty of it , because similarly , we cannot use the law to ban christianity , or ban you from practicing your faith , no matter how much some of us would like to . third , what about the fact that your god wants you to treat every man as his brother , and that you must never judge as only god can judge , and that god loves everybody ? imagine 2 christians one vehemently against homosexuality and same sex marriage . the other who accepts and loves everybody , including gays , as equal . each professes their actions in the name of god . who is right ? who s wrong ? do i throw them a couple of knives and let them fight it out , and accept the answer of the one who wins ? that is your dilemma . the interpretation of religion is , in and of itself , subjective . you may not subject your subjective interpretation of morality onto the rest of the population using the law , because that s what slave owners did . that is far more immoral than anything you have conjured up against same sex equality .

why not start a twitter poll or a poll here on reddit to see which of your rights should be stripped .," 1st off , you re such a hypocrite . a successful male orgasm releases not just semen , but serotonin too . anyone who claims not to enjoy the serotonin release is not being honest with himself , or a proper psychopath . how is it being a hypocrite ? also , just because you orgasm doesn t mean you enjoy it such as in cases of rape . it is not wise to insist that orgasm mean the person enjoyed it as it can be forcefully brought out through specific stimulation of erogenous regions . couple of times during primary school . 377a wasn t even part of the consideration , it s more traditional male toxicity . and do you speak for everyone ? i have given you a link already from aware where a male sex assault victim has mentioned how 377a frightened him into not pursuing the case . i ve no issues against equal rights . but wouldn t the striking down of it , emboldened homosexual harassment ? how does it embolden homosexual harassment ? please explain and provide evidences to support this claim . there is nothing that would do so , given that sexual harassment is against the law regardless of gender . in fact , it would lower it by making victims less scared of approaching the police for help . dear , some of us do suffer worse fates . and if some are worse , the others don t get to fight for equal rights ? just be honest and state that you don t like lgbtq people . i ll respect you more for owning your bigotry than your current sealioning . i fear conversion therapy for enjoying it too much . by most accounts , guys give better blowjobs . since the equipment is intrinsically understood . you have horribly misunderstood conversion therapy if you assume it s just getting a blowjob from a guy . and if you truly believe in conversion therapy , you would do it on yourself . after all , you don t seem to want to give lgbtq people a choice and instead want to convert them if you think being lgbtq is a nuture issue . here you re complaining about western imports . there your opponents are complaining about western imports too . guess it all comes with the free port internet . surprise ! lgbtq was prevalent in asia . we had homosexual emperors in china , the bugis had 5 genders , and bisexuality is probably pretty common in china with the whole sworn brothers thing going on . all these stopped after christianity was imported over , while the spread of islam in parts of asia contributing to it too . but not keen about this sexual identity revolution making it down to our schools . which is eventually needed , to change general mindsets . what kind of sexual identity revolution are you talking about . stop creating boogeymen to hide your bigotry of wanting lgbtq people to be invisible . looking at the discrimination biblical jews christians faced . which is why it is disappointing that they have turned it around to bully others . it obviously doesn t matter to me , much as it does you . this actually makes things worse given that arguing for the discrimination and oppression of your fellow citizen is happening because you just want a distraction . as for the btos the rest of the equal rights , it s obviously unfair . but is it any fairer to demand that your priorities , are others too ? so what would you call fair ? the barring of specific groups of citizens from affordable housing for something they re born as ? just because it allows others to benefit from it ? so start trading support . can be anything from womens rights , to death penalty abolishment drugs decriminalisation . and you seem to be ignorant of the fact that we already do so . lgbtq organizations have repeatedly spoken up on womens rights , death penalty abolishment , migrant workers treatment , and so on . so even you don t support a public referendum on this issue . just expect various political parties to risk more votes for less votes , dying on your hill . that s a beautifully principled stance , good luck with that ! go ahead with a public referendum on your rights first . why not start a twitter poll or a poll here on reddit to see which of your rights should be stripped . after all , if you are ok with it happening to others , you should be ok with it happening to yourself .

bto housing is meant as a policy tool for a few purposes .,"kunkka said hdb policy is anything but broadstroke and full of case by case basis . thats because of the multitude of criterias set . on paper can say no rom take back bto . how many times have i seen people drag this for years after bto collections not to mention sale of hdb before mop . u clearly have no experience with hdb . might as well say why are we preventing people from renting out hdb during mop since cannot check and hard to enforce . confiscation of hdb isnt new . if having a child was ever a requirement . i am sure a case by case basis procedure will exist no different from what we have now if having kids is too draconian for you so many ways to encourage designated usage of hdb . ban removing room wall during mop since u already need hdb approval for that im not acting smart you are the one that started name calling . click to expand . . . lol you have no idea what it means by a broadstroke policy . bto housing is meant as a policy tool for a few purposes . it is not meant solely for procreation . 1 subtle usage is as a form of procreation encouragement amongst other purposes . this is but 1 of the few things the government tries to encourage people to have children , there are other tools used such as baby bonus , subsidized childcare , working mother subsidy etc . 1 no rom take back bto the rule is 6 months after u collect keys . there is random checks performed and it s not a hard enforcement . yes there are cases when some people only rom a year later but eventually all do . do u know of any cases where people never get married and still held on to the hdb flat ? conversely , what you are saying is that confiscate back the flat if the couple does not have kids after 12 months ? 24 months ? what time frame is going to be used ? what if the couple has kids after that time frame ? it s very different as the childbearing timespan can last 10 years . on average if we use the median marriage age of women which is 29 today . the childbearing years is 16 years on average with the bulk being in the next 10 years . so your example is stupid with reference to rom . 2 sale of hdb before mop is subject to special approval and certain t cs have to be met . again this is sporadic and not too many vs confiscating back hdb when childless proposal u said . you have not given a feasible practical method when i questioned on the details on how can this be done . that s why i m calling you out as trying to be a smart aleck .

"i will not discuss if homosexuality is actually a sin or not , and will not debate this with anyone , because i don t believe that such a debate will go anywhere for anyone .","hello , christian here . this is not meant to be an argument and i have no intent to try to prove you wrong , but i d just like to share what i believe in regard to the 6 points mentioned above . i m well aware that it s likely that i will get downvoted to oblivion , but i thought i d just put some thoughts out too . i have not read any of truelove . is https truelove . is s articles and i am not trying to represent or defend their words and actions . i am putting out my personal belief on what the christian faith is meant to be , and what i think that means in this context . i am simply trying to clarify any possible misunderstandings of what christianity represents to anyone who may view christianity negatively because of this . i will not discuss if homosexuality is actually a sin or not , and will not debate this with anyone , because i don t believe that such a debate will go anywhere for anyone . anyway , here is what i believe internalised homophobia come to think of your attractions as dirty , sinful , hell worthy through social programming and peer influence , internalise the thought that you are exceptionally and profoundly flawed . well , to be honest , everyone does things hell worthy . doesn t matter whether its a lie , anger , or a murder . i m not sure about you , but i think i m flawed , and that s why i need the grace of god in my life . so yes , gay or not , i don t think anyone is perfect and deserves to be spared from hell . but there comes the part where it s god s grace through the death of jesus that gives us a way back . self flagellation reinforce the inferiority from 1 by reminding yourself of the need to purge yourself of homosexual desires in order to escape hell yet , these desires return , and your daily struggle between purity and damnation continues . again , no one is perfect and we all have different areas that we need to improve in . but i don t believe god expects perfection out of us . we re simply not capable of that . instead , he wants us to simply do our best . so yes , we should always be struggling to change whatever we know that isn t right that we re doing i . e . addictions , negative thoughts , bad habits . but again , it doesn t mean that if we don t do enough , we re going to hell . because salvation is not achieved by how good we are , but by the grace of god . what this means is that even if we do everything wrong in our life , it doesn t mean that there s no way out of hell . on the flip side , it also doesn t mean that if we only do a little wrong , we re fine . rather , it means that what determines if we go to heaven or not is simply whether we believe in what jesus did for us and accept that gift of salvation . again , i understand if you do not believe in christianity or god , i am simply putting out what i believe in and what i feel that the church and truelove . is https truelove . is should be presenting . to put this in a more straightforward way , it means that when i want to change myself and fix what i think or know i m doing wrong , it s not because i m scared of going to hell . it s because i love god and want to give my best to him . coming out come out to your society as one struggling with ssa invite more people into your structure of sexual policing , so that self flagellation is reinforced by the threat of actual social condemnation . the church should never be condemning or segregating anyone who is lgbt . if anyone here has faced discrimination by the church or people in the church , i would like to apologize on behalf of them . i believe that when someone comes out as lgbt in the church and wants to change , it should always be out of their own convictions , and not social pressure . the church should always be there to support people who want to change , not coerce people into thinking what they do is wrong . support , not condemn . going back in you realise that even though you pray and talk about it , your ssa never goes away you think this reflects badly on your own piety you entrench your social position as that person who struggles with ssa . soon , you become defined both by your ssa and your failure to move past it . become the subject of failure , in a repeated but never perfected act of failing . you internalise the judgment of your society . i think this isn t something that is limited to ssa . it s the same thing for alcoholism , drugs , bad habits , addictions , and really whatever else . it s always a struggle to change the ways that you re so used to . if we removed the negative connotations , i guess you could compare it to trying to adjust to a new culture . anyway , i believe that we re all works in progress , which means that you struggle , i struggle , we all struggle . but we struggle together and run together . and it also doesn t mean that if i can t find a breakthrough , i m a failure . instead , to me , it takes time . it takes me to really rely on god for help , because i cant breakthrough by my own ability or strength . i would want to emphasize again that the motivation to change any behaviour or mindset for me is always out of love for god . it s not because i have to , or just because it s right . it s always a matter of conviction . life goes on around you , but not in you your straight friends move into relationships , get married , live unified lives . you remain chaste , celibate , and you feel loneliness make its home in your heart . surely , holiness is its own reward . i don t have much to comment on this , other than i guess time will tell ? as aforementioned , i don t intend to make any case for whether homosexuality is a sin or not . learning to love the abuse tell yourself that the trauma you suffer from the above processes is a badge of honour that you happily wear in order to prove your piety you link your socially conferred sense of self worth to pain that is transmuted into pleasure . true love is straight love , and since that is what you can never experience , it is something you don t deserve . i don t fully understand what this statement means , so if op or anyone else could kindly explain it to me , i would be glad to share what i think as well . however , i do not think true love straight love , and i will talk about that as well in a short while . x200b i think to summarise everything i ve said here , what i truly believe true love is , is well stated by 1 corinthians 13 4 7 . 4 love is patient , love is kind . it does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . 5 it does not dishonor others , it is not self seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . 6 love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . 7 it always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . and to be honest , i don t think any of us are capable of this fully , at all times . not you , not me , not the senior pastor of a church , not the smartest theologian . only god has this love , and i will always be thankful for it . our human love will only be so much but a fragment of that . so no , true love isn t a matter of sexual orientation . x200b edit thanks for the gold , kind stranger ! edit 2 since everyone seems to be telling me i m missing the point , you re absolutely right . i m not trying to make an argument or prove anyone wrong . so yes , i am missing the point . i m just trying to shed light on what we christians see , from my perspective .

professionals specialised in treating the transgender community , after the gender identity clinic at national university hospital closed in 2008 .","singapore even though information about transgender issues has proliferated across the internet and become more accessible , people in singapore who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria still find it difficult to find resources here and get adequate medical treatment and acceptance , experts and transgender youth said . gender dysphoria refers to the psychological discomfort or distress experienced by an individual who believes that there is a mismatch between his or her sex and his or her gender identity . non governmental organisations ngos who support transgender people told today that gaps still remain even though healthcare accessibility has improved over the years . many healthcare professionals still lack the knowledge to treat transgender people , and public information about the resources available remain scarce and inaccessible , they said . transgender youth who were interviewed said that they face inadequate support at home and in school , and struggle to gain acceptance . unlike many other social taboos that have been shed , the taboo associated with transgender issues is still there and it has contributed to some of these problems , the ngos said . read also moe denies stopping transgender student from getting hormone therapy , says it is in no position to interfere with medical treatments they added that this stigma and the inadequate institutional support is damaging to students with gender dysphoria , some of whom have even resorted to buying hormone replacement pills from unauthorised websites . these gaps were thrust under the spotlight two months ago , when a transgender student named ashlee alleged that the ministry of education moe had prevented her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone replacement therapy , the treatment recommended for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in a 2016 study by medical journal the lancet , estimates suggested that about 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 per cent of the global population are transgender . there is no official estimate of the number of transgender people among singapore s population . healthcare accessibility opened in 2017 , the gender health clinic under the institute of mental health imh is believed to be the only public hospital in singapore to have a team of medical professionals specialised in treating the transgender community , after the gender identity clinic at national university hospital closed in 2008 . transgender patients who wish to seek help from the clinic can get a referral through public hospitals or polyclinics . read also review of singapore s mental healthcare system underway , as mps highlight existing gaps however , transgender sg , an organisation that collates resources for the transgender community in singapore , said that getting this referral is not that straightforward , because many public healthcare workers do not know what to do when a person with gender dysphoria approaches them . this was the case for kaeden lim , 17 , who sought professional medical support from regular psychiatrists at a public hospital when he was 12 due to struggles with gender dysphoria and his mental health . it took more than a year and four psychiatrists before he was finally referred to imh s gender health clinic . today spoke to kaeden s parents , who confirmed that kaeden is a patient at the gender clinic and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2018 . the teenager recalled how even after he had told the doctors that he identifies as a transgender male , they continued to use female pronouns when addressing him . it was only at the imh gender health clinic that kaeden received the support he was looking for when a doctor at the clinic validated his experience as a transgender person . read also decisions on use of hormonal therapy rest with clinicians and their patients moe , imh all three transgender students whom today interviewed said that their experience at the gender clinic was affirming and positive . their frustration , though , lies with having to wait around three months between appointments because there are only a handful of doctors servicing the clinic . when contacted about the issue , imh declined to comment . there are options available for patients to go to a private doctor for medical support , but many choose not to because the prices for private consultations can be up to two to four times higher than public consultations . professor tsoi wing foo , a psychiatrist in private practice who has treated patients with gender dysphoria for 50 years , said that some patients choose to go to him for treatment first while waiting for an appointment in the public hospital , which can take a few months . since 2007 , he has seen 1 , 000 patients with gender dysphoria . most of his patients are between the ages of 18 and 30 . read also gender dysphoria schools can work out practical arrangements with students if there are valid medical grounds , says lawrence wong the young people interviewed by today said what makes matters worse is that information and resources for healthcare support is not easily accessible . for instance , they found out about how to get a referral to the imh gender clinic through a private online community and the information was not available publicly . transgender sg has a list of healthcare providers that cater to transgender people , but it does not make this information public due to fears of societal backlash . lack of social support then , there are some young transgender people who are unable to begin hormone replacement therapy due to lack of support from family . this was the case for lexi not her real name , who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019 . lexi let today see the appointment cards , receipts and correspondence from a hospital showing that she is a patient at the imh gender health clinic and has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in singapore , individuals below 21 have to get permission from their parents before they can be referred to an endocrinologist , who specialises in treating conditions related to hormones and hormonal glands . because lexi s parents are against her medically transitioning , the 18 year old has resorted to buying hormone pills off unauthorised websites without a prescription . she relies on the accounts of other transgender women to figure out how much to take . the ngos told today that this is a common occurrence within the community for those who do not have support to transition but are desperate to start the process . doctors are warning that buying and using hormones from websites can be dangerous . dr abel soh , an endocrinologist at mount elizabeth hospital , said that there are many unbranded hormone treatments available online that may not necessarily provide the same concentration of hormones stated . taking hormones without monitoring their levels in the blood via blood tests may potentially result in excessive usage , he said . agreeing , dr ben ng from arden endocrinology specialist clinic said that gender transitioning is a complex and multi pronged process . professional evaluation from a medical doctor is necessary to ensure that the therapy prescribed is appropriate and safe . both specialists said that taking the wrong prescription of hormones could lead to significant health problems , including increased risk of blood clots , heart disease and stroke . even when transgender students have family support , they might feel alienated in school because the institutions often are not equipped to help them , the patients and experts said . for instance , students face hurdles over which uniform they can wear or which toilets they can use . this was the case for junior college student jules not her real name , who started hormone replacement therapy last year . today confirmed with jules parents that she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and is seeing a doctor at the imh gender health clinic . during a disagreement with the school over which uniform she should wear , the 18 year old was asked to wear a lab coat over her physical education attire during science practical class . jules said that this has made her feel more anxious because she now stands out among her peers , who wear either long pants or skirts during these lessons . she has also resorted to drinking as little water as possible and holding her bladder to avoid using the bathroom in school . if i could describe it in one sentence , it s like i m going out with an extremely bad haircut every day just constantly being self conscious because of this

we need to decouple both arguments 377a is an unjust law civil union rights for same sex couples for the sole reason that the latter is going to face some form of conservative backlash that will obstruct progress in the former .," u shadex8 remember how we discussed this ? once 377a repeal is coupled with same sex union rights what the lgbtq movement ultimately wants the strategy that will employed by conservatives would be to frame it as an attack on the institution of marriage and the family unit . this is been something we ve already seen in american politics . and oh boy once it s framed in that way the lgbtq movement will start losing it s current majority because it s polarizes the argument and pushes conservative moderates to the far right i see that in my own communities . this delays progress and turns productive discussion into some tribalistic football match . i personally feel its a lot easier to get everyone to agree that 377a is a unjust law because it clearly is that needs repeal . then slowly work out the process of defining what a civil union is , defining what the interests of the state are for a civil union and subsequently what rights and privileges a civil union should have . we need to decouple both arguments 377a is an unjust law civil union rights for same sex couples for the sole reason that the latter is going to face some form of conservative backlash that will obstruct progress in the former .

it avoids framing the real issue should same sex couples be allowed to raise children ?,"i extend to you the courtesy of a reply . i will be brief and rather take the conversation private as i genuinely feel threatened for voicing out an opposing view to the current lgbtq narrative . addressing your proposals in order 1 . it is tyrannical to tell students or anyone else what to think . mandating such education pressures students against forming an opposing view . 2 . it is radical to use tax payers funds to pay for sex change operations . first of all , it is radical for a male to want to amputate part of his body . it is radical to substantially alter hormone levels in the body . i define radical as the dictionary defines radical . if a person wants radical surgery , he can pay for it himself . that i do not object to . 3 . no objection here . i will advocate for the individual right to choose . whomever he or she marries is a personal choice . 4 . i do not understand the full implications of affirming only support . what does it exclude ? hence i cannot support what i do not fully understand . 5 . use of ivf for same sex couples is radical . it avoids framing the real issue should same sex couples be allowed to raise children ? that is a radical change of social structures , for children to have 2 mommies or 2 daddies . though i do agree that 2 moms or 2 dads will be better than a single parent the vast majority of the time . 6 . this is a radical change as well . our limited public housing is reserved for the family unit as defined by the housing authorities . a shrinking love population has been a problem for decades , so housing policy is geared towards families . same sex couple do not normally reproduce so this point cannot be separated from point 5 and point 3 , marriage and must be decided together . 7 . to muslims this would be the most radical and anything that tampers with the teachings of their holy books is extremely radical . 8 and 9 . this seeks to redefine the social constructs of gender beyond biology . nature made it simple females have eggs , males have sperms . and then there are hermaphrodites . but its very simple eggs , sperms or both . perhaps science will advance one day sufficiently to gift reproduction to transgenders . but that day is not today . 10 . it is immensely tyrannical to tell a person what to pray or what not to pray for . that is an affront to all good sense . i do not believe that lgbtqs should be persecuted . but i also believe that society should not be forced to dramatically change in a radical manner that will cause more division between groups .

"chief justice dipak misra said that criminalising homosexual sex is irrational , arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional .","singapore was part of the british empire . it was once administered by the british from calcutta kolkata . many of our laws , including the penal code , were imported from india . the indian penal code , in section 377 , criminalises carnal intercourse against the order of nature . sodomy was considered a crime under section 377 . section 377a of the singapore penal code makes it a crime for two consenting male adults to have sex with each other in private . it does not penalise sex between two consenting female adults . the first question is whether section 377a should be repealed . the second question is whether 377a is consistent with our constitution . the scientific evidence singaporeans are a rational people . we make our policies and laws based on facts , science and reason . what is the scientific evidence on homosexuality ? is it a form of mental disorder which can be cured ? or is it a normal aspect of human sexuality ? in 1973 , the world health organisation who deleted homosexuality from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders . this decision was endorsed by the general assembly of who in 1990 when it agreed to delete homosexuality from the list of mental disorders . in who s view , being lgbt lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender is not a disease . scientists do not know what determines a person s sexual orientation , but they theorise that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic , hormonal and environmental influences and do not view it as a choice . they favour biologically based theories , which point to genetic factors . scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in itself a source of negative psychological effects . scientists also believe that there is insufficient evidence to support psychological interventions to change sexual orientation . sodomy and the world the united nations has 196 member states . the majority , 124 states , do not criminalise sodomy . however , the minority of 72 states , including singapore , do . which societies belong to the majority ? all the countries of europe , north america and south america do not criminalise sodomy . it is of interest to point out that china , japan , south korea , hong kong , taiwan , the philippines and thailand also belong to the majority . it is therefore not the case of a liberal west versus a conservative east . which countries make up the 72 which criminalise sodomy ? they are the arab countries , the muslim majority countries and , surprisingly , the former british colonies of asia , africa and the caribbean . singapore is part of the minority mainly because it inherited from the british a penal code which criminalises sodomy . for a country which embraces science and technology , it is surprising that , on this one aspect , the law has not been updated , in the light of the scientific evidence . sin and crime the national council of churches of singapore , the catholic archbishop , and the islamic authorities have issued statements against the repeal of section 377a . they regard homosexuality as a violation of their religious dogmas and therefore a sin . my good friend , former attorney general walter woon , has pointed out that there is a fundamental difference a sin and a crime . he said that many regard adultery and fornication as sinful but these are not criminal behaviour . he concluded that sodomy may be a sin but it should not be made a crime . he is also unhappy with the compromise of retaining 377a and not enforcing it because it brings the law into disrepute . there is an important point which i wish to make to the christian and islamic authorities . i would respectfully remind them that singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian country or a muslim country . it is not the business of the state to enforce the dogmas of those religions . in singapore , there is a separation between religion and the state . church leaders and islamic leaders should respect that separation . role of courts in most cases , the antiquated sodomy laws were repealed by the legislatures of the respective states or countries . however , in a few cases , the laws were declared unconstitutional by the courts . in 1960 , every state of the united states had a law criminalising sodomy . by 2003 , only 14 states , including texas , had such laws . in 2003 , the united states supreme court made a landmark decision in lawrence v texas . the court held , by a majority of six to three , that the texas law criminalising sodomy was unconstitutional . speaking for the majority , justice anthony kennedy said the petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives . the state cannot demean or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime . the ruling in effect invalidated anti sodomy law in the other 13 states as well . but today , 15 years later , most of these states have not repealed the anti sodomy law . however , it is considered unenforceable as the supreme court has ruled it unconstitutional . in september 2018 , the indian supreme court overturned its earlier decision of 2013 , and ruled that section 377 of the indian code was unconstitutional . this was the unanimous decision of a panel of five judges . chief justice dipak misra said that criminalising homosexual sex is irrational , arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional . another judge , indu malhotra , said history owes an apology to the lgbt people for ostracising them . in 2014 , the issue of the constitutionality of section 377a was considered by the court of appeal in the case of lim meng suang v attorney general . the court ruled that the law was not unconstitutional . i believe that the court s judgment was wrong . i hope that the court of appeal will overturn its 2014 decision if it is presented with an opportunity to do so . i will conclude with the following four propositions . first , the scientific evidence is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality . it is not a mental disorder . second , section 377a is an antiquated law , not supported by science , and should be repealed . third , singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian or muslim country . the leaders of those religions should respect the separation of state and religion and refrain from pressuring the government to criminalise conduct which they consider sinful . fourth , the court of appeal should overturn its 2014 decision and declare 377a to be unconstitutional . veteran diplomat tommy koh is chairman of the centre for international law and rector of tembusu college , both at the national university of singapore .

"however , 8 out of the 10 companies refuse to hire trans people ."," but conversely , there is no need for affirmative action as imo , it is very insulting as it implies that they have to resort to policies , rather than their own efforts , to be selected . affirmative action is meant to counter inequality . if you accept that lgbtq people are currently discriminated against and not treated equally , it would thus make sense to be in favour of affirmative action to even out the playing field . for example , say xiao hua is a trans woman with qualifications that would otherwise give her 50 chance of getting an interview . she applies to 10 companies . if she wasn t trans , she would likely get 5 interviews . however , 8 out of the 10 companies refuse to hire trans people . so out of the remaining 2 who treat everyone fairly , she only gets 1 interview , and thus overall loses out compared to her equally or less qualified non trans peers . however , say those 2 other companies engaged in affirmative action that prioritise hiring lgbtq people , and give them lower barriers to entry . this would mean that she stands a better chance at getting 2 interviews instead of 1 . it s still much less than the 5 that she is actually qualified for , but every bit helps . ultimately , the goal would be to eradicate discrimination so that lgbtq people have the same chances as everyone else to get hired based on their ability , and when that happens , there would be no more need for that affirmative action . this doesn t say anything about lgbtq people s own efforts , because when the status quo is discriminatory , only the very best performers stand a chance at achieving what the average person does . which is good for those people , but it still leaves average or below average lgbtq performers struggling in ways that their non lgbtq peers do not have to . on a tangent if anyone is interested , the asia pacific transgender network found that employment discrimination against trans people was worst in singapore compared to malaysia , vietnam and thailand overall , our data indicated that the worst discrimination against trans people was in singapore , with trans women and trans men affected to a similar extent . cis applicants there were 81 . 5 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response 76 . 5 percent more likely for cis women and 90 percent for cis men , and 107 . 2 percent more likely to get invited to interview , more than double 112 . 5 percent for cis women and 100 percent for cis men . they also elsewhere noted that for trans female applicants , some of those interviews turned out to be sexual solicitations . source https weareaptn . org resource denied work an audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in singapore ",17-11-2022 10:49,Reddit,trans,-1

"rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public .","when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021 19:59,Reddit,trans,0

"because rights are not intrinsic , but are fundamentally creatures of societal morality which may be enshrined as laws ."," adopting that has given us slavery , racism , sexism , homphobia and now islamophobia . but the converse is also true , as society develops over time , its collective moral opinion progresses and it gradually decide that these abhorent practices are wrong and to be abandoned . no one 100 years ago could have predicted the tremendous advancements in gender rights , for instance . if our children s generation decided that beef is immoral due to its carbon footprint , would you like your grandkids to condemn you for enjoying a sirloin steak ? i don t know about you , but a government relying on morality from the majority , especially if it s not a factually supported position , seems to cause many issues . as long as governments make policies based on morality it will primarily take into account the moral values held by the majority of the population , whose support it relies on . otherwise , how do you think governments should decide on questions of morality ? why are we using subjective morality to govern what rights another person has again ? because rights are not intrinsic , but are fundamentally creatures of societal morality which may be enshrined as laws . for example , an american has the right to bear arms because of the second amendment , but the second amendment remains in place despite all the school shootings because it is indelibly etched into the american psyche that guns are a fundamental liberty . at heart , rights only exist because a state is willing to exert force to preserve them , or restrict its own power in respect of these rights . but this only happens if enough people believe that all people should be entitled to them , and would support a government who enshrine them into law . otherwise , the only rights you will have is what you can defend . x200b ",02-04-2019 21:42,Reddit,rights,0

"i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against .","unfortunately i went to watch the whole thing because i wanted to hear them out before commenting . i ll just summarise my observations and give some thoughts . the reporter and the dialogue centre director generally said thing that were more to the side of empathy towards the lgbtq a . k . a queers , i want to use this word instead because it s easier and can represent true community . the reporter didn t say much , and the director mostly shared stories about folks from the queer community . he also shared about how there needs to be civil dialogue , and this point about having dialogue is something that generally everyone in the panel agreed with . he didn t introduce this point btw . most of the sharing came from the pink dot pd rep . he shared experiences about queer folks , highlighted about how everyone should be able to express themselves , have civil discussions and etc . i m feel that he did alright pertaining to the issues discussed , in general . the 3 16 rep was mostly concerned about cancel culture , spoke about how his church helped to equip parents to handle when their children come out , and shared experiences about discrimination from one person who was called a homophobe and was bullied and he claims that person is not actually a homophobe . i hold no love for his pov , what surprised me is that he said he has same sex attraction and shared a bit about his time while he was active in the gay community . the first topic was about today s poll about 377a repeal and same sex marriage is it wrong , and is it important to define it as man and woman . pd rep says it s an opportunity to talk to these people and educate them , while 3 16 says that these respondents likely did their homework and came to the conclusion that marriage s definition as man and woman should stay , citing the if you allow gay marriage , then what s next ? ? ? type of fear mongering . there s a lot that could have been discussed and i think this debate could have taken up the entire hour , but in general i don t like the 3 16 s assumption that all respondents have researched opinions . i would hypothesise that they actually just answered in a way that supports the government s reasoning government says we are repealing 377a but keeping marriage s definition as m f . therefore 377a is bad . uphold definition of marriage as m f is good . we live in a effectively one party state , and i would say that the trickle down of opinions on social matters from the government could be the reason for this . if you disagree with my hypothesis , that s valid . unfortunately the today survey didn t ask why people responded this way . it just noted that religious people were more likely to support 377a s stay , and support the definition of marriage as m f . btw the 3 16 guy said that saying the framing of these statistics shouldn t be confined to religion . this is something that is contradicted by the reporter s article . the article highlights that religious people are the ones who are more opposed to 377a and prefer m f marriage definition . but the reporter mostly just nods as if she doesn t want to say that she highlighted that religious people were more opposed in her article . like , why else would the reporter highlight that religious people were more opposed if it religion isn t a main factor ? anyways then they discussed about the safety of queer folks in sg . generally the director and pd rep said that there s a lot of emotional and psychological damage , and not so much of physical although there is some in the form of getting kicked out of the house for example . 3 16 guy s response was that there are were cases of people having different ideas about queerness who were discriminated . he said i had one guy who was accused of being homophobic despite not being homophobic , and he was bullied . he also had one other example relating to work but it s similar in nature to his point . i mostly agree with the director and pd rep . 3 16 rep was basically pulling the old i m actually the victim card . christians and muslim make up like more than 30 of the population 2020 singstat , while queer people only make up like 12 2022 ipsos as i ve mentioned it s usually religious people who are highlighted as the opposition to queer rights , so i feel that he is wrong to try and play the victim here . the predominant culture has been to suppress queers . this guy even talked about the police raids on gay scenes many years ago . this 12 is the weaker community , whilst the 30 have the numbers and a long standing culture of heteronormativity in the country . is bullying anti queer people wrong ? arguably yes , but it s likely much less of an issue than queer bullying . there was a lengthy session about cancel culture , basically everyone say cancelling is wrong and we should talk things out . i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against . like dude , you learnt to suppress your true sexual self . i would feel bad for you if you weren t part of a church that works to convert people into abstinence from their same sex attractions . also , the issue is not about attraction . who you are attracted to could largely be kept secret . it is hard to discriminate by who youre attracted to . it is , however , easy to discriminate against people who act on those attractions because they are engaging in a physical act that can be caught seen by other people . don t equivocate attraction with the issue being discussed , which is about expressing thoughts and ideas . it s not the same topic and isn t relevant . another thought is that i wish that the pd rep talked about how cancel culture is something that is not just done by the left , it s also done by the right . if i come out to my conservative christian extended family , they aren t going to just agree to disagree they ll call me a sinner and likely ask me to go for conversion therapy or repent . that is cancel culture too . i expressed my thoughts and got shamed , and was silenced and asked to reform . tbc edit some spelling and grammar fixes . lack of brainpower to fix everything",16-11-2022 23:12,Reddit,same sex,1

panellist who helms a podcast said that there needs to be accurate representation of lgbtq individuals in the media it is not possible for everyone to come to a consensus on lgbtq issues , but there must be a willingness to talk , he added singapore young singaporeans are less accepting of family members having same sex relationships than they are of their friends and colleagues as they apply different values on both groups . while they apply tolerance on their co workers , other values such as their notions of morality or the traditional family unit come into play when dealing with a family member . researcher mathew mathews , who was speaking during a today live webinar on friday nov 19 , said so in my family setting , i would want that value to operate . i need people to live within a certain kind of boundary . dr mathews , who heads the social lab at the national university of singapore s institute of policy studies , was commenting on the findings of the today youth survey 2021 . the survey , which polled 1 , 066 respondents between the ages of 18 and 35 in early october , found that more than 70 per cent of respondents were willing to accept friends or work alongside those having same sex relationships , but 58 per cent were willing to accept family members who do so . relating his personal experience , another panellist on the webinar , mr yeo sam jo , said that the difference in attitudes towards friends or family members who are homosexual could also stem from a place of concern . mr yeo , who helms the sg boys podcast that discusses gay issues , said that when he finally told his parents last year that he was gay , his mother expressed concern over whether he would face discrimination at work or be treated differently by people due to his sexual orientation . i can t speak for why there is a discrepancy in the survey results as a whole but if you go by a case by case basis , i think a lot of it really boils down to the stigma of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq identity , he said . friday s webinar was streamed at 8pm on today s instagram and tiktok accounts . the topic for the second instalment of this year s four part webinar series was on youth attitudes on lgbtq issues . the event was moderated by cna presenter elizabeth neo and also featured today s supervising editor yasmine yahya as a panellist . media portrayal of lgbtq community the panellists of the webinar also discussed the portrayal of lgbtq individuals in the media . today s survey found that a third of the respondents 33 per cent felt that the community was positively portrayed , while almost half 46 per cent were neutral about it . about a fifth 22 per cent said that the portrayals were negative . on this , mr yeo said that it was not just enough to have representation of lgbtq individuals on screen , but also have accurate portrayals that did not dehumanise , rely on tropes or portray such individuals in a negative light . he cited the example of the chinese language drama series , my guardian angels , which aired on mediacorp s channel 8 last april . the series had faced criticism for featuring a paedophile character who molested teenage boys and had sexually transmitted diseases as well as a character who was worried about the sexual orientation of her son . mediacorp had apologised last july for causing offence and distress , and reiterated that there was no intention to depict the lgbtq community in a negative light in the series . such portrayals perpetuated stereotypes of the lgbtq community , such as how gay people spread sexually transmitted diseases and are sexual predators , mr yeo said . as individuals with aspirations and dreams , members of the lgbtq community would appreciate positive portrayals in the media , he added . on the portrayal of lgbtq issues in the news media , ms yasmine said that today is still navigating its way on how to report such issues fairly without flouting laws on how they could be portrayed . today has thus tried to centre the community s voice in an accurate , fair and non judgemental way in the hope that reports on lgbtq issues will be read by the wider public , she said . legislation the panellists also touched on the question of whether lgbtq individuals can be equals in singapore without legislative changes , such as the repeal of section 377a of the penal code that criminalises consensual sex between men . to this , ms yasmine said that only time will tell if there will be legal changes in singapore , but in the meantime , individuals can create safe spaces for lgbtq persons in their work settings , social spaces or at home . mr yeo said that even if section 377a is repealed , mindsets about the lgbtq community , such as how it is here to tear apart the fabric of society , must also change . if anything , we are all for stability and cohesion as well . we want to be part of this society as much as you are . we want to feel like we belong . building consensus ms neo asked the panel about the concerns of people in society who are opposed to the normalisation of lgbtq issues . dr mathews said that it stems from how people frame the idea of a family . these segments of the population have questions about an alternative way of running a family , whether it would be viable and its impact on children of homosexual families . on whether different segments of society will ever reach a consensus on lgbtq issues , ms yasmine said that it is not possible to convert everybody . drawing parallels with the feminist movement , she said that there will always be pushback from society whenever progress is made . however , society must keep fighting for change while trying to reach across the divide and build bridges between groups who have opposing views , she added . agreeing , mr yeo said that it is not possible to force someone to agree in something they do not believe . however , it is important that the different groups are mature and open minded enough to listen and be receptive to what the other side is saying . he added if there s no willingness to sit down and have a

9 per cent were not in favour of gay marriage .,"article repost slightly more than half or 55 per cent of singaporeans still support section 377a of the penal code , even as one in three singaporeans is more accepting of same sex relationships than he or she was five years ago , a new survey has found . the online survey by ipsos public affairs , an independent market research company , was conducted over a period of four days from end july to early august 2018 to understand the current social attitudes towards same sex relationships . a total of 750 singaporean citizens and permanent residents aged 15 to 65 took part in the study . when asked the extent to which they supported or opposed section 377a of the penal code , which is the law that criminalises consensual sex between adult men , more than half 55 per cent indicated that they supported it , while 12 per cent said they opposed it . sentiment varied according to gender , with males more likely to strongly support the law than females . singaporeans aged 15 to 24 were more likely to oppose the law , while singaporeans aged 55 to 65 were more likely to support it . singaporeans were also asked the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the statement i believe that singaporeans should be able to participate in same sex relationships . twenty eight per cent agreed with the statement , while 38 per cent did not . a 2014 survey of more than 4 , 000 singapore residents conducted by the institute of policy studies similarly found that singaporeans are largely conservative . in the study , 78 . 2 per cent of respondents said that same sex relationships were wrong , while 72 . 9 per cent were not in favour of gay marriage . however , 33 per cent of singaporeans in the ipsos study agreed with the statement i am more accepting of same sex relationships than i was five years ago , while 35 per cent disagreed . the survey results come as the question of whether the law would be repealed in singapore was raised after the indian supreme court struck down a similar section of the indian penal code last thursday sept 6 . since then , online petitions to keep it and repeal it have been started by separate groups of individuals . when asked about the indian ruling last friday , law and home affairs minister k . shanmugam said in singapore if you look at this issue , it is a deeply split society . the majority are opposed to any change to section 377a , they are opposed to removing it . however , he said a growing minority want to have it repealed . the government is in the middle , he added . last saturday , he said that whether section 377a will be repealed or amended will be a matter for parliament to decide . he added that depending on the legislation , public opinion is often relevant during policymaking in parliament . ipsos said the findings indicate that attitudes towards the issue of same sex relationships have changed and are likely to continue to change , albeit at a slow pace . this change was attributed to perceptions of shifts in singapore s social norms with respect to same sex relationships , increased conversations on social media and more direct exposure to same sex relationships . said ipsos associate research director robert mcphedran this research indicates that the normative values of singaporeans with respect to lgbtq lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer issues are gradually shifting . he added as has occurred in other countries globally , increased dialogue regarding same sex relationships has contributed to higher acceptance among singaporeans . this is particularly the case for the younger generation . nonetheless , as pm lee has previously noted , a social consensus remains far from being reached .

marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order established by god , one sins and offends god . same sex marriage does just this . accordingly , anyone who professes to love god must be opposed to it . marriage is not the creature of any state . rather , it was established by god in paradise for our first parents , adam and eve . as we read in the book of genesis god created man in his image in the divine image he created him male and female he created them . god blessed them , saying be fertile and multiply fill the earth and subdue it . gen . 1 28 29 the same was taught by our savior jesus christ from the beginning of the creation , god made them male and female . for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife . mark 10 6 7 . genesis also teaches how god punished sodom and gomorrah for the sin of homosexuality the lord rained down sulphurous fire upon sodom and gomorrah . he overthrew those cities and the whole plain , together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil . gen . 19 24 25 ",11-06-2015 10:18,Reddit,same sex marriage,-1

"maybe for abortion i can see why people would be upset and think its murder or something , but equal rights for the lgbt community ?"," in a media statement released after ndr 2022 , apccs chairman reverend yang tuck yong said , the repeal is an extremely regrettable decision which will have a profound impact on the culture that our children and future generations of singaporeans will live in . looks at the countries which decriminalised homosexuality and the ones which haven t nah i think we re gonna be okay apparently , lgbt inclusion and economic development are mutually reinforcing too https www . sciencedirect . com science article pii s0305750x19300695 however , we also recognise that the government seeks to bring about a balance among many differing viewpoints on this matter . we strongly urge the government to entrench the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman in the singapore constitution . that would be the most prudent way forward . i really really don t understand this view point . i really really don t . please explain to me why your view point should be held to the same level of importance when it reinforces the current discrimination and withholding of human rights to people ? to me , i think this has a similar level of absurdity to the abortion debate , but perhaps even more ridiculous . both issues are individual issues for the lack of a better word , as in no third party rights are lost when pregnant people have an abortion or when lgbt individuals have equal rights . maybe for abortion i can see why people would be upset and think its murder or something , but equal rights for the lgbt community ? come on . in a statement on its website , the church added , however , we seek protection of the family and marriage according to natural law and our rights to teach and practise them unhindered . we must not allow reverse discrimination to take place against those who believe in marriage as defined between a man and a woman . reverse discrimination ? ? ? ive seen this being thrown around so many times but it never fails to crack me up at rhe insanity of it . pray tell , what exactly are they being discriminated against ? i havent been told a single reason everytime i ask this question , because there simply is no reason having equal rights doesnt mean that these people who are against lgbtq suddenly cannot be against lgbtq anymore or are forced to support them . they still can . its js that maybe you cant openly say anti lgbtq stuff if an lgbtq anti discrimination law is passed , which would be similar to anti discrimination laws for race lgbtq people aren t forcing religious institutions to wed them or forcing the government to give them affirmative action . all we want is just to be treated like cishet people and have equal rights when it comes to healthcare , housing , marriage , etc of which , id argue that healthcare and housing are also human rights taking comfort in the government s plan to enshrine the definition of marriage in the constitution , it added , otherwise , we will be taking a slippery road of no return , weakening the fabric of a strong society which is founded on the bedrock of holistic families and marriages . slippery road of no return ? ? looks at the countries which have already legalised same sex marriage nah i think we ll be fine also what on earth is a strong society ? to me , it s one that is resilient and can work together to overcome challenges . i don t think you can do that very well if there s still a proportion of the population who doesn t have equal rights some of them i would think are also human rights holistic families and marriages huh . holistic is the idea of comprehensiveness . completeness . which is ironic because i think a society which is accepting and supportive of lgbtq individuals is closer to that than whatever we have now lgbtq people are part of families too . if we celebrate families without celebrating the lgbtq people who are in these families , that s not very comprehensive , is it ? and the idea of lgbt families being not holistic , or in other words , not complete is very strange to me . what are they missing ? love ? trust ? happiness ? i don t know ",22-08-2022 07:04,Reddit,rights,1

"in the context of lgbt rights , it s important to note that when the christian groups in singapore say that something is immoral , they also mean therefore it should be illegal .","i m going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you want some good faith discussion , so i ll bite . i ll also respond to this post in particular , because i think it has flagged up some useful themes . i m not going to reply point by point , because i think the items i mention below broadly covers wjat upi have raised . 1 . i think it should be obvious , but just so we are on the same page law and morality are related , but distinct concepts . what is moral need not be law , what is law is not necessarily moral divorce is legal , despite some seeing it as immoral . in the context of lgbt rights , it s important to note that when the christian groups in singapore say that something is immoral , they also mean therefore it should be illegal . this is logically unsound , and also inconsistent with how our system of laws work it is also basically religious imperialism , where what one religious group considers immoral is not banned for everyone , even though christians barely make 20 of the population . this hypocrisy is entirely evident here , where nina acknowledges that legality does not confer morality , but at the same time she is entirely supportive of 377a remaining illegal . 2 . religious people derived their morality from a number of sources , and it s wrong to think that in practice they derive morality solely from the bible . in theory , yes , christians i ll just use christiains since i am the most familiarity with the bible should accept the morality of the bible 100 , but in practice , they do what the rest of us do some parts of the bible are emphasized as being more important love and acceptance , while other parts are ignored , or explained away as no longer being applicable the part where god tells moses to commit ethnic genocide and rape women . an honest christian will acknowledge that the morality of god ordering genocide is something that is difficult to justify , but he she can only have faith in god s larger plan . i see this as being pretty standard for any religion there s a lot of faith involved in believing that a deity exists , and that he is good . for a non religious person , the ability of christians to understand that genocide in the bible is not really a good thing , shows that there is some form of external morality that is being used to assess the acts in the bible . 3 . on this precise issue , calling being gay immoral is wrong because the bible assumes that we have free will and it is in that context that sins make sense you generally can only sin if you actually choose to sin an inadvertent unintentional sinful act is not sin . the cause for gay ness is a complex question . it might be genetic or otherwise . however so long as there is a small amount of people who are indeed born gay , then this immoral analysis completely breaks down it would mean that god created these people who are doomed to be especially sinful , compared to the rest of us .

public toilets are a source of major anxiety and stress for most if not all trans people .," and as such i think its appropriate that the usual societal norms apply instead of giving transgender people a choice use the toilet corresponding to the sex you are most commonly identified with , not your gender . while i agree on principle , the problem with that framing is that it implies trans people aren t already doing so , and need a law to tell us what is basically common sense as well as a matter of our own safety . so that can come across as patronizing and is one reason for the backlash . it s more or less standard practice for trans people to only switch toilets once they re regularly read as that gender , and to use unisex handicapped toilets or not go at all when in early transition . public toilets are a source of major anxiety and stress for most if not all trans people . so the idea that someone would willingly choose to use a toilet where they stand out more and thus experience more stress is counterintuitive . it s also typically the trans person experiencing the greatest discomfort in those scenarios , whereas i find that a lot of those examples tend to assume that it s everyone else who is uncomfortable while the trans person is totally chill . i thus believe that trans people should have a choice , because figuring out what toilet you should go to is stressful enough without bringing the threat of the law into it . sometimes it s based on fluctuating criteria like if 4 out of 5 strangers a trans woman met today addressed her as xiao mei , then she would be better off in the female toilets . but if she just had a haircut and everyone has been calling her xiao di , then maybe she ll choose to use the male toilets on that day . there s really not much incentive to do otherwise , unless someone wishes to intentionally stand out to make a political statement but that s another matter altogether , and wouldn t apply to most cases . especially when it s singaporeans , who are mostly obedient and afraid of confrontation .

singapore , said that getting this referral is not that straightforward , because many public healthcare workers do not know what to do when a person with gender dysphoria approaches them .","singapore even though information about transgender issues has proliferated across the internet and become more accessible , people in singapore who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria still find it difficult to find resources here and get adequate medical treatment and acceptance , experts and transgender youth said . gender dysphoria refers to the psychological discomfort or distress experienced by an individual who believes that there is a mismatch between his or her sex and his or her gender identity . non governmental organisations ngos who support transgender people told today that gaps still remain even though healthcare accessibility has improved over the years . many healthcare professionals still lack the knowledge to treat transgender people , and public information about the resources available remain scarce and inaccessible , they said . transgender youth who were interviewed said that they face inadequate support at home and in school , and struggle to gain acceptance . unlike many other social taboos that have been shed , the taboo associated with transgender issues is still there and it has contributed to some of these problems , the ngos said . read also moe denies stopping transgender student from getting hormone therapy , says it is in no position to interfere with medical treatments they added that this stigma and the inadequate institutional support is damaging to students with gender dysphoria , some of whom have even resorted to buying hormone replacement pills from unauthorised websites . these gaps were thrust under the spotlight two months ago , when a transgender student named ashlee alleged that the ministry of education moe had prevented her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone replacement therapy , the treatment recommended for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in a 2016 study by medical journal the lancet , estimates suggested that about 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 per cent of the global population are transgender . there is no official estimate of the number of transgender people among singapore s population . healthcare accessibility opened in 2017 , the gender health clinic under the institute of mental health imh is believed to be the only public hospital in singapore to have a team of medical professionals specialised in treating the transgender community , after the gender identity clinic at national university hospital closed in 2008 . transgender patients who wish to seek help from the clinic can get a referral through public hospitals or polyclinics . read also review of singapore s mental healthcare system underway , as mps highlight existing gaps however , transgender sg , an organisation that collates resources for the transgender community in singapore , said that getting this referral is not that straightforward , because many public healthcare workers do not know what to do when a person with gender dysphoria approaches them . this was the case for kaeden lim , 17 , who sought professional medical support from regular psychiatrists at a public hospital when he was 12 due to struggles with gender dysphoria and his mental health . it took more than a year and four psychiatrists before he was finally referred to imh s gender health clinic . today spoke to kaeden s parents , who confirmed that kaeden is a patient at the gender clinic and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2018 . the teenager recalled how even after he had told the doctors that he identifies as a transgender male , they continued to use female pronouns when addressing him . it was only at the imh gender health clinic that kaeden received the support he was looking for when a doctor at the clinic validated his experience as a transgender person . read also decisions on use of hormonal therapy rest with clinicians and their patients moe , imh all three transgender students whom today interviewed said that their experience at the gender clinic was affirming and positive . their frustration , though , lies with having to wait around three months between appointments because there are only a handful of doctors servicing the clinic . when contacted about the issue , imh declined to comment . there are options available for patients to go to a private doctor for medical support , but many choose not to because the prices for private consultations can be up to two to four times higher than public consultations . professor tsoi wing foo , a psychiatrist in private practice who has treated patients with gender dysphoria for 50 years , said that some patients choose to go to him for treatment first while waiting for an appointment in the public hospital , which can take a few months . since 2007 , he has seen 1 , 000 patients with gender dysphoria . most of his patients are between the ages of 18 and 30 . read also gender dysphoria schools can work out practical arrangements with students if there are valid medical grounds , says lawrence wong the young people interviewed by today said what makes matters worse is that information and resources for healthcare support is not easily accessible . for instance , they found out about how to get a referral to the imh gender clinic through a private online community and the information was not available publicly . transgender sg has a list of healthcare providers that cater to transgender people , but it does not make this information public due to fears of societal backlash . lack of social support then , there are some young transgender people who are unable to begin hormone replacement therapy due to lack of support from family . this was the case for lexi not her real name , who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019 . lexi let today see the appointment cards , receipts and correspondence from a hospital showing that she is a patient at the imh gender health clinic and has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in singapore , individuals below 21 have to get permission from their parents before they can be referred to an endocrinologist , who specialises in treating conditions related to hormones and hormonal glands . because lexi s parents are against her medically transitioning , the 18 year old has resorted to buying hormone pills off unauthorised websites without a prescription . she relies on the accounts of other transgender women to figure out how much to take . the ngos told today that this is a common occurrence within the community for those who do not have support to transition but are desperate to start the process . doctors are warning that buying and using hormones from websites can be dangerous . dr abel soh , an endocrinologist at mount elizabeth hospital , said that there are many unbranded hormone treatments available online that may not necessarily provide the same concentration of hormones stated . taking hormones without monitoring their levels in the blood via blood tests may potentially result in excessive usage , he said . agreeing , dr ben ng from arden endocrinology specialist clinic said that gender transitioning is a complex and multi pronged process . professional evaluation from a medical doctor is necessary to ensure that the therapy prescribed is appropriate and safe . both specialists said that taking the wrong prescription of hormones could lead to significant health problems , including increased risk of blood clots , heart disease and stroke . even when transgender students have family support , they might feel alienated in school because the institutions often are not equipped to help them , the patients and experts said . for instance , students face hurdles over which uniform they can wear or which toilets they can use . this was the case for junior college student jules not her real name , who started hormone replacement therapy last year . today confirmed with jules parents that she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and is seeing a doctor at the imh gender health clinic . during a disagreement with the school over which uniform she should wear , the 18 year old was asked to wear a lab coat over her physical education attire during science practical class . jules said that this has made her feel more anxious because she now stands out among her peers , who wear either long pants or skirts during these lessons . she has also resorted to drinking as little water as possible and holding her bladder to avoid using the bathroom in school . if i could describe it in one sentence , it s like i m going out with an extremely bad haircut every day just constantly being self conscious because of this issue , she said .

"highlighting how 377a acts as a barrier to reporting , ms anisha said regardless of police or prosecutorial discretion , the possibility of being investigated for a criminal offence ."," but under reporting of sexual abuse remains an issue partly due to legal barriers experts more males are reporting being molested , continuing a rising trend in recent years , though experts flag that under reporting remains an issue for sexual crimes , in part because of legal barriers . last year , 116 males were victims of molestation , about 1 . 5 times the 74 cases in 2010 close to 80 per cent of male victims last year were aged 21 and below . this comes as the total number of molestation victims rose to 1 , 672 last year , from 1 , 511 in 2010 . while a rise in figures could be due to more people committing the crimes , experts pointed to other possible factors like greater awareness of sexual offences and assurances that cases will be treated sensitively . but institute of mental health imh senior clinical psychologist kenny liew noted that under reporting of sexual abuse remains a major issue . this is partly due to legal barriers , said ms anisha joseph , who heads the sexual assault care centre sacc run by the association of women for action and research . rape is narrowly defined under the current penal code where only women can be victims , she said , referring to more serious cases . we hope that this will soon change with the penal code review committee s recent recommendation to make it a gender neutral offence . another barrier is section 377a of the penal code , she told the straits times . the section criminalises any act of gross indecency between men , in public or private . this deters both straight and gay men from making police reports , she said , citing feedback from those who sought help at sacc . survivors may fear being investigated for prior non coercive , consensual acts with either the man they reported , or with other men . the sacc itself has seen a rising number of sexual assault cases involving male victims . in the first half of this year alone , there were 12 cases , compared with 15 for the whole of last year and 13 in 2016 . where the details were known to sacc , close to nine in 10 of the male victims knew the perpetrators , who included relatives and intimate partners . in 80 per cent of these cases , the perpetrators were men . this is consistent with national trends . of the 975 people arrested last year for molestation , all but 11 were males . highlighting how 377a acts as a barrier to reporting , ms anisha said regardless of police or prosecutorial discretion , the possibility of being investigated for a criminal offence . . . can be traumatic . lawyer gregory vijayendran , president of the law society , too , noted that section 377a could be a double edged sword . while it could still serve a salutary purpose to ensure the male perpetrators of sexual abuse are punished . . . it is not inconceivable that a victim may not report due to concerns of being punished for the same offence , he said . male to male sexual abuse also falls within the ambit of section 376 on sexual assault by penetration . the issue comes amid recent discussions on 377a , with attorney general lucien wong saying this month that the government has not removed or restricted prosecutorial discretion for the section . such legal issues add to other deterrents to reporting that sexual assault survivors might face . for example , said mr vijayendran , if the abuser is someone in authority and a respected figure in society , the victim may wonder if he will be believed . for men , there may be another layer involved coming out to their families , friends or employers , who may not know their sexual orientation . with societal stigmatisation that exists in some quarters , this could prove a realistic psycho social barrier to a male victim lodging a police report , said mr vijayendran . ms anisha said survivors may meet with disbelief and victim blaming comments . imh s mr liew said many boys and men may still believe the myths that if he experienced sexual arousal during the abuse , he wanted and or enjoyed it , and thus the abuse was his fault .
