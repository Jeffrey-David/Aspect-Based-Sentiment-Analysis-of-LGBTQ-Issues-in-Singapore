what about adoption eligibility and being recognized as the next of kin ?," what s stopping you from migrating to australia ? money , mostly , though if singapore doesn t change within the next 10 years then i will seriously consider migrating . the point is that you want to marry for love , which is not highly valued in singapore corporation really ? what about adoption eligibility and being recognized as the next of kin ? especially so when there are many singles by choice you mean singles but cohabiting ? most of asian culture has viewed marriage as a political and financial tool where marriage have been dictated by parents . sigh . . . i m not sure if that s true or not , but if it is , that seriously sucks . i guess i get what you re saying . cohabit instead of marrying , and that s another path i can take too , yeah . i will lose benefits like cheaper hdb and legal recognition though . but regardless of marriage or cohabiting , 377a must go .

"a closeted homosexual , when determining whether to come out or not , would only come out if he she is absolutely certain of their own homosexuality .","thanks for your reply ! honestly i was skeptical if you were a troll at first , but i m glad you replied . i admit that cases like what you refer to in your first few cases do exist . if you re in a minority community of anything , anyone seeking to leave can be seen as a traitor to people possessing extremist points of view . let me be clear . there are definitely extreme homosexuals out there . but there are many other normal , friendly homosexuals out there . many more , i m willing to wager . just as while christians with extreme points of view , muslims with extreme points of view , etc do exist , there are many many more normal people just like you and i . however , we re missing the point here . extremist gays not willing to let others go are not representative of the entire gay community , and just because they exist doesn t mean that every single gay out there is evil . and judging from your words , i m sure you ll agree that homosexuality in itself is not inherently sinful ? if you do , that that s exactly my point . homosexuality is not inherently sinful . as a bit of a tangent , let s examine the point about the gay traitors thing . the fact is , coming out as a homosexual is in itself a very difficult task , and there are many closeted homosexuals out there . if you want me to dig up the numerous articles out there about homosexuals coming out only to be bullied , cast out by their families that may not even be religious , i might add , so nothing against your religion here ! , i can . let s say 10 of all men in singapore come out as gay . a closeted homosexual , when determining whether to come out or not , would only come out if he she is absolutely certain of their own homosexuality . just go and google about coming out stories . it isn t a hmm im not sure if im gay , so i ll just try it out thing , it s an actual commitment . often a homosexual who comes out is very certain of their own homosexuality . so , maybe only 0 . 1 of the self proclaimed gay men in singapore are not confident of their own homosexuality . so these stories , while shocking , is not a common experience of most homosexuals . for someone to come out as gay and then come back out as straight is already not very common . yes , it is a problem that they re hounded by extremist gays , but the fact is it s a far bigger problem that gays experience discrimination from the government and from people . sorry for the tangent . onto your sidetrack . as a counterpoint , i ve never seen those against the gay agenda push their opinions with love . if you use the bible as an argument , you re labeling it as sinful . you re effectively saying that your religion dictates that that person belongs in a place of eternal torment because of their sexual orientation , and that you see nothing wrong with that . that sounds pretty hateful to me . i m not a christian , so i quote these from wikipedia s quotations from the bible leviticus 18 22 do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman that is detestable , leviticus 20 13 if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . they are to be put to death their blood will be on their own heads these are often quoted by christians as reasons why homosexuality is wrong . and . . . i don t know , the bolded text sounds really hateful to me . as for your opinion on gay people giving hateful arguments to push the gay agenda , i can t outright say that it s wrong since it s your opinion , but it s only your experience . and that s the nature of the internet , especially echo chambers like reddit and twitter where any dissenting opinion is shot down viciously you need not look further than the downvotes on your post . it s not the place for discussions like this . i cannot refute this because it s your own experience , but i hope me engaging you in this discussion would help although personally i m not gay . sorry , i don t understand what you mean . what i m saying is don t back your argument on the bible , because it s not something the other party believes . it s like arguing with someone with a different set of beliefs imagine a pastafarian trying to convince you the true god is the flying spaghetti monster simply based off his own bible . you don t believe in the flying spaghetti monster , while he does . to him it s only logical that the true god is the flying spaghetti monster , while to you it s an illogical argument . the same thing applies to using the bible to refute homosexuality .

i think that progress can happen faster than people think it could the most important step is for citizens to talk about it openly and proponents of same sex rights to not be afraid of backlash to their jobs and familial relationships .,"i would like to write about why i think google is doing something that s great for singapore . google has effectively helped several of the problems that lgbt citizens face in singapore the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship , and the lack of resources for grassroots movements in singapore to happen effectively . the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship lgbt media in singapore suffers from significant censorship and lgbt citizens have little say in how their life is fairly portrayed in mainstream media . compare and contrast the two different events below in 2006 , brokeback mountain passed completely uncensored into singapore . http news . bbc . co . uk 2 hi entertainment 4716610 . stm however , in 2007 , we have censorship of gay sex scenes in a small local movie festival . http pluralsg . wordpress . com 2007 04 24 gay sex scenes in local movie solos censored although i may stand corrected on the details , the article mentions that more graphic scenes that were not lgbt generally passed uncensored . but the biggest problem i have is with the guidelines on lgbt censorship in singapore . this problem can be seen directly from the bbc article on brokeback mountain singapore s media content director said ang lee s film was passed as it did not promote or glamorise the lifestyle . the idea of censoring media that promotes or glamorizes lgbt issues hosts the problem of whether media showing homosexuality as a normal occurrence constitutes as promoting or glamorizing . for example , the bbc article references that but in 2004 , taiwanese film formula 17 , which was about two teenage boys falling in love , was banned because it portrayed homosexuality as normal , and a natural progression of society . you can see that the reason for censorship is completely different the movie was censored because it showed someone living a normal lgbt life if you could somehow call it that way . and if you seriously consider something innocuous as this as a promotion or glamorization of lgbt lifestyles , then honestly , what exactly can pass the censors for lgbt citizens to get their message across that lgbt citizens are people too ? either way , the directive for censorship is incredibly vague and leaves plenty of room for the censor boards to do whatever they want , or the censor boards are simply being inconsistent with their censoring . these are both troubling conclusions . the lack of resources in grassroots movements in singapore for those in this thread who are worried that google is simply using its corporate clout to lobby the singapore government , the article states that that s not what google is trying to do their strategy involves developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . http dot429 . com articles 2012 07 06 google wants the world to legalize love google s strategy is not so much of lobbying the government directly so much as developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . i find this heartening because i ve attended lgbt support groups in singapore and see that they are sorely lacking on funds to do something impactful . the people who work there are definitely passionate about improving the lives of lgbt singaporeans a key part of oogachaga one of the support groups is to provide support for lgbt singaporeans to re connect with their families because of the fear of being ostracized when coming out . while i think this a great cause to support that appeals to the family first mentality of singaporeans , they don t have quite the funds to extend their reach to most singaporeans . considering the last event i went to had about 25 young adults attend , this is really small when you consider that singapore has more than 4 million citizens . google and barclays were the largest sponsors of pink dot 2012 a grassroots movement that has become very successful , although it s an event where 99 of the participants are lgbt citizens . i went to the last one and although there were supporting families who came , they were few and far between . conclusion overall , i think the move by google and the support provided by citi and ernst young gives me some hope that same sex rights can be established in my generation . i think that progress can happen faster than people think it could the most important step is for citizens to talk about it openly and proponents of same sex rights to not be afraid of backlash to their jobs and familial relationships . google is definitely helping here .

section 292 criminalizes the procession of pornographic materials , but as it is also rarely enforced , does it constitute of institutional discrimination of people who watch and download porn ? will i be fired from work , kicked out of house because the government legalized institutional discrimination towards people who love porn ? no ? same for 377a . so you don t care cause it technically doesn t affect you since i assume you are a post op transgender ? ok but other people do care that gay man can be charged for having sex with consent . liberals and activists love to claim gay discrimination in singapore . in an interview with buro 247 , writer and activist yi sheng ng claims , as a community that faces discrimination , where if our identities are known we face the risk of being bullied at school , abused in our families , and fired from work , we can t just sit back and wait for society to become nice . really ? the community faces discrimination ? doxxed ? bullied in school ? abused at homes and fired from work ? which third world part of singapore do you live in ? let me know , i ll investigate personally . eh there are so many cases and anecdotes of lgbtqs being bullied in school , kick out from their house , shun from the community , especially a religious one . there is even a shelter for homeless transgender who are kicked out and hotlines and counseling services for lgbtqs . yes , discrimination towards the lgbt exists , it exists in individualized employers , traditional families and social and religious groups . however there is barely any institutional homophobia nor discrimination towards gays in singapore . come on gays , let s not just make it all about you . yes , racial , age and religious discrimination exists , and the ministry of manpower and the tripartite alliance for fair and progressive employment practices tafep have their relevant legislation and guidelines on handling discrimination , and to ensure hiring practices that are fair and based on meritocracy and non discriminatory practices . facing discrimination at your workplace ?

where is the action to translate into a concrete action for the collective wishes of the lgbt community , ie , repell 377a and to legalize gay marriage ? what next for the lgbt individuals in singapore ? nothing changes . the government allocated hong lim park as a speaker s corner for singaporeans to gather and to host events the only designated spot in singapore . as the government knows , singaporeans need an outlet to vent off steam , just as much the pubescent 13 year old teen sneaks his elder brother s porn stash into his room to vent every once in a while . and that s exactly what pink dot is doing an annual venting of steam . 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 worth of community donations every year ? yup , they go to av sound systems , equipment rental , apparels and decorations , so that you can make it a grand party to get together and rah rah . so at the end of it , where do the funds go ? how about any towards at risk groups for the lgbt community ? and when the last confetti is tossed and the last pink champagne popped , what happens next for the lgbt community ? nothing . it s like an sg50 party year after year after year . fair enough if you don t feel that it helps , although some may argue that the fact that it has become popular means that the government has taken note of it and have to be more wary when reviewing such laws . it may take some time , but it is entirely possible they might with enough public pressure . it also shows lgbtqs that hey people in singapore do care about you and do want to ensure that you have equal rights as other singaporeans . also , it fun to piss off the waapd crazies . want to help the plight of the lgbt community in singapore ? put your money to real causes to help the marginalized lgbt individuals . there are much more worthy causes in singapore , see project t , a shelter for homeless transgenders in singapore oogachaga , a counseling and personal development agency for lgbt individuals . pink dot ? nope . oh wait , didn t you say that discrimination against lgbtq wasn t that serious , so why have such organizations ? oh btw , i believe oogacha sp is a sponsor and pink dot does highlight what they do to the public . finally , there s nothing proud to be gay just like there s nothing proud about being straight . if you are gay , you are just as normal as the next straight guy , why do you need a event to celebrate being gay ? how about let s make july hetrosexual pride month ? no ? i personally do not need pink dot nor a gay pride parade because i live with pride everyday of my life and surround myself with friends and loved ones . i am proud of my career achievements , my life experiences , and not because of my identity . i don t need an annual virtue signalling parade to make me feel good about who i am . the fact is , i am a singaporean first , and a transgender second . i would rather be celebrated for the former than for being different as the latter . pink dot this year ?

the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage .," it is not marriage calling something marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order

"so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society ."," the moe vs . trans debate has nothing to do with culture wars 2 feb 2021 top image still from video speaking in parliament on monday , education minister lawrence wong said that schools can be flexible in making arrangements for students with gender dysphoria , and that our main focus is continuing to provide them with a conducive learning environment and to support their overall well being . he also added that issues of gender identity have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies , and that we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . this is the first time the issue has been addressed in parliament since a trans student , identified as ashlee , claimed that moe had interfered with her hormone replacement therapy on reddit . she also said her school threatened to expel her over it as well . following this , 5 individuals protested outside the moe building last week . in parliament , wong addressed and validated the challenging experiences of students with gender dysphoria , which is a step towards opening conversations on the matter . but by claiming that western gender issues could potentially divide our society , attention was directed towards vague forces rather than on placing accountability on key players in ashlee s story . everything about the debate is singaporean let s look at the claims made and the parties involved in the ashlee vs . moe debacle a singaporean trans student alleges that a singaporean government institution moe interferes with her medical treatment for gender dysphoria , which was diagnosed by imh , another public singaporean institution , while her local singaporean school threatens to expel her over it . every party involved is either a singaporean or a singaporean institution . from ashlee s lived experience in her school as a trans student , to the bodies involved in granting her transition , it is difficult to pinpoint any culture war , let alone western influence at play . don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery . ashlee s grievances were rooted in trying to maneuver the often hostile path to accessing medical treatment for gender dysphoria as a student . for example , she claimed that before commencing hormone therapy , her psychiatrist was told by moe that they needed to be consulted before treatment could proceed , and that to date , no approval letter had come . she also said that her school called for a meeting with her father , where she was told she would be expelled if any physiological changes from hormone therapy would result in her being unable to wear the boys uniform . ashlee s case is about medical and education policy in singapore . trying to blame or pinpoint western forces or ideologies is a distraction , as it does little to help us unpack why the gap in guidelines came to be , and how it can be rectified . the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented . if anything , comments about a culture war may only spark one where it doesn t exist . why are we still talking about ashlee s story ? the reason why students protested outside moe last week and why netizens continue to discuss ashlee s story is because no definite conclusion has come of her case , not because of an ideological debate . if you look at discourse online and even the comments under her most recent post on reddit , netizens don t seem to be so concerned with whether being trans or undergoing hormone therapy is right or wrong , but rather , with picking apart the claims made on both sides . no official investigation has been launched , and while moe refutes the students claims , the public has been given no definitive answer about how the situation was handled . one voice that remains surprisingly silent in this time is that of ashlee s doctor , who could instantly help clarify the matter and put an end to online speculation . so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society . share with us your thoughts on this story at community . co . if you haven t already , follow rice on instagram , spotify , facebook , and telegram . author edoardo liotta 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",02-02-2021 17:51,Reddit,trans,0

"she said well obviously the bible doesn t approve of it , and that there s been no proof that homosexuality is an inborn biological trait .","i actually did some of my own csi into this programme a few months ago . i called the church number and inquired about this ministry , and the lady on the line actually passed me the contact number of the gay conversion therapist herself . i actually called her and we had an hour long conversation about what she does . it was enlightening in the worst way possible and here are some key takeaways 1 i asked her about the demographics of the people she sees . she told me most of her patients are young gay men in their late teens and early twenties . most of them come from christian backgrounds and attend church and were referred to her via word of mouth . 2 i actually asked her if she saw more gays or lesbians . interestingly , she told me that the people who see her don t call themselves identify as gay or lesbian , they refer to themselves as struggling with same sex attraction . she told me that people who identify as gay or lesbian don t go for conversion therapy . 3 i asked her to tell me more about herself , her age , qualification etc . she is in her thirties , with a bachelor s in psychology from sim , and received further training from counselling and care centre ccc . the ccc is a non profit organisation providing counseling services that is affiliated with the national council of social service ncss which is a governmental organisation . this was shocking as counsellors therapists if i m not wrong need at least a master s degree to legally practice as counsellors or psychologists . so the gay conversion therapist was unqualified . 4 i asked her about the success rates . she said that turning them straight isn t actually the goal , and that most don t become straight afterwards . bingo . straight from the horse s mouth . she said it s more about managing the desires and feelings . 5 i asked her about how she she goes about doing it . basically it was religious talk therapy with bible reading and prayer thrown in . 6 i asked her about her views on homosexuality . she said well obviously the bible doesn t approve of it , and that there s been no proof that homosexuality is an inborn biological trait .

"don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery ."," the moe vs . trans debate has nothing to do with culture wars 2 feb 2021 top image still from video speaking in parliament on monday , education minister lawrence wong said that schools can be flexible in making arrangements for students with gender dysphoria , and that our main focus is continuing to provide them with a conducive learning environment and to support their overall well being . he also added that issues of gender identity have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies , and that we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . this is the first time the issue has been addressed in parliament since a trans student , identified as ashlee , claimed that moe had interfered with her hormone replacement therapy on reddit . she also said her school threatened to expel her over it as well . following this , 5 individuals protested outside the moe building last week . in parliament , wong addressed and validated the challenging experiences of students with gender dysphoria , which is a step towards opening conversations on the matter . but by claiming that western gender issues could potentially divide our society , attention was directed towards vague forces rather than on placing accountability on key players in ashlee s story . everything about the debate is singaporean let s look at the claims made and the parties involved in the ashlee vs . moe debacle a singaporean trans student alleges that a singaporean government institution moe interferes with her medical treatment for gender dysphoria , which was diagnosed by imh , another public singaporean institution , while her local singaporean school threatens to expel her over it . every party involved is either a singaporean or a singaporean institution . from ashlee s lived experience in her school as a trans student , to the bodies involved in granting her transition , it is difficult to pinpoint any culture war , let alone western influence at play . don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery . ashlee s grievances were rooted in trying to maneuver the often hostile path to accessing medical treatment for gender dysphoria as a student . for example , she claimed that before commencing hormone therapy , her psychiatrist was told by moe that they needed to be consulted before treatment could proceed , and that to date , no approval letter had come . she also said that her school called for a meeting with her father , where she was told she would be expelled if any physiological changes from hormone therapy would result in her being unable to wear the boys uniform . ashlee s case is about medical and education policy in singapore . trying to blame or pinpoint western forces or ideologies is a distraction , as it does little to help us unpack why the gap in guidelines came to be , and how it can be rectified . the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented . if anything , comments about a culture war may only spark one where it doesn t exist . why are we still talking about ashlee s story ? the reason why students protested outside moe last week and why netizens continue to discuss ashlee s story is because no definite conclusion has come of her case , not because of an ideological debate . if you look at discourse online and even the comments under her most recent post on reddit , netizens don t seem to be so concerned with whether being trans or undergoing hormone therapy is right or wrong , but rather , with picking apart the claims made on both sides . no official investigation has been launched , and while moe refutes the students claims , the public has been given no definitive answer about how the situation was handled . one voice that remains surprisingly silent in this time is that of ashlee s doctor , who could instantly help clarify the matter and put an end to online speculation . so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society . share with us your thoughts on this story at community . co . if you haven t already , follow rice on instagram , spotify , facebook , and telegram . author edoardo liotta 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",02-02-2021 17:51,Reddit,trans,1

proponents of gay marriage always argue that marriage is a social construct .,"apologies for a day late reply , was busy . there s alot of angsty downvoters who don t even dare to participate in discourse . you guys are the definition of circlejerk , and the reason why we can t have nice discussions on reddit , grow up please . singapore is a secular nation . marriage is not a religious one but a civil institution as per singaporean law . churches will also not be forced as it is in the us to perform same sex marriages . i never said we weren t a secular nation . i wholly agree we are a secular nation , and i detest people on the white shirt camp who invoke the bible to denounce gay marriage because it s against their beliefs . yes , churches will not be forced , but in the us , those who upset the gay community will face huge budget cuts , threatening their very survival . technically , they are still allowed to reject the marriage of gay couples . while facing minor consequences of course . can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being discriminated against i don t believe in discriminating against gay people . i treat them as fellow human beings . those who discriminate against them are doing so out of fear , and i abhor such practice . would anyone be fine with not having equal rights ? i assume the right you are talking about is the right to marry . this really frustrates me . marriage isn t a right , it s a privilege . which is why in singapore or anywhere in the civilised world , both parties must consent before a marriage licence can be issued . if marriage regardless of the sex was truly a right , we d have a shit ton of problems . we don t have the right to marry animals for example . and this privilege is decided by the state . proponents of gay marriage always argue that marriage is a social construct . this lends even more credibility to the argument that marriage is not something we should inherently be given , it is simply a privilege and a standard we humans have invented , and set to adhere to . are they advocating that christians be stripped of their basic rights a group that actively calls for another to have less rights again , marriage is not a right . unless you are talking about the right to be an individual , the right to be treated as a fellow human being . then what i have written above already addresses this . i don t think the majority of white shirts are advocating discrimination of gays , those who do are the religious zealots , and a convenient straw man for the pro pink dot to attack . would you give anti vaxxers or climate change deniers the same legitimacy these are debates that are fundamentally different in the fact that they do not involve social constructs . let me explain further . we don t give anti vaxxers legitimacy because it is scientifically untrue . if white shirts argued that homosexuality is unnatural , i wouldn t be giving them any legitimacy either , because it has already been scientifically proven it does occur in nature . however , the issue at hand is whether homosexuals should be granted marriage . and this is a social construct , something that science has little authority in . therefore yes , we have to grant the anti gay movement legitimacy because this isn t a science debate , this is a social debate that involves an institutional standard we have believed in and referenced for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . no one s saying homosexuality is a fabrication . but people are saying that marriage should not be extended to include homosexuality . people have followed the traditional construct of marriage for hundreds of years , and allowing homoesexuals to marry on the basis of sexual attraction trivialises this institution . think of it as christianity and buddhism if a bunch of buddhists decided to mix the 2 beliefs together and then proceed to tell christians that they should expand their definition of christianity to include them , aggressively asserting that it is their right to be recognised by christianity while calling others who oppose them as bigots and narrow minded , most people would disagree . because in this scenario you shouldn t be trying to identify with a religion , you have essentially created your own . coincidentally you brought up the point about being antagonistic , but can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being told their narrow minded definitions of marriage should coalesce with the idea of same sex marriage something born out of sexual attraction ? i haven t once invoked a non secular argument , and i believe that the secular case against gay marriage can be made . edit formatting",11-06-2016 22:56,Reddit,gay marriage,0

. the petition allegedly collected 10 , 000 signatures in three days , and was significant enough to warrant a mention by our minister for law , k shanmugam , in his statement regarding the event . interestingly enough , this petition was posted on a site called citizengo , which has strong ties to european far right political networks . the site is full of petitions advocating for the rollback of lgbtq , abortion , and gender equality rights all over the world , ranging from the cayman islands and iran to ireland and canada . they are also iconic in many parts of the world for the money they put into their sloganeering freespeechbuses , which have made their way across boston , rome , and even nairobi . citizengo itself is based in spain , and has ties to the far right vox party , as well as other ultraconservative religious figures and politicians throughout europe and the us . using this site to collect signatures for local singaporean political issues is , in fact , a clear case of foreign interference . citizengo has a very clear political agenda , and there are no checks or methods of authentication to verify the user s nationality or country of origin . one of us entered fake personal details and listed our location as slovakia , complete with a fake postal code . the signature was successfully accepted . the anti lgbtq movement here frames its arguments in terms of fighting against foreign intervention , claiming to represent asian values or the true singaporean . yet , this petition points to how their rhetoric and strategies are heavily borrowed from the west . in fact , members of the public have no way of knowing how many signatures were actually registered by local singaporeans . in comparison , last year s repeal 377a petition , which recorded 50 000 signatures , ensured the integrity of its petition by using gopetition , which required signatories to declare their postal code and nationality . the numbers recorded in that petition not only reflected the ground better , but also allowed it to be submitted to the penal code review committee and local members of parliament . the pro lgbtq camp is constantly challenged for not being singaporean enough . thio li ann memorably said in 2007 that repealing 377a would be copying the sexual libertine ethos of the wild wild west . in recent years , groups like we are against pinkdot in singapore frequently bought up the presence of mncs sponsoring pink dot as a form of foreign interference , which may have led to the 2016 ban on foreigners and foreign funding for events that take place in hong lim park , including pink dot . the spectre of foreign interference looms large over any discourse promoting lgbtq rights , to the point where we miss the reality that the anti lgbtq movements are just as influenced by foreign discourse , if not more so . a quick glance through we are against pinkdot and singaporeans defending marriage and family brings up dozens of posts bashing , amongst other things , american politician mitt romney and swedish environmental activist greta thunberg . despite representing asian values , these pages fixate on the rhetoric of american politics , far more so than lgbtq pages such as the pink dot facebook page . the discourse of lgbtq rights and speakers being foreign funded ultimately obscures from the public eye the relationship between global ultraconservative movements and local anti lgbtq movements . with the upcoming 377a court challenges , we should remain cautious to the fact that foreign and local are fundamentally unstable categories , especially in a country like singapore , which is so open to the flow of people and ideas from all over the world . what used to be foreign is now suddenly local , as we can see with the history of section 377a itself a law enacted by the british colonial government . for one group to claim to be more local over another group being foreign is a futile gesture . this does not mean we have to abandon these concepts altogether . rather , we must critically engage with individual cases and not assume localness or foreignness . in citizengo s case , claims to singaporeanness provide a veneer of legitimacy where there is none . nobody in the lecture theatre where dr . guruswamy spoke was under the impression that she was singaporean or commenting on singaporean politics . in contrast , the citizengo petition repeatedly frames itself as a representation of local voices speaking out against murky , hidden foreign agendas . if we are to go with the anti lgbtq camp s definition of foreign interference , this could well be its ultimate manifestation . author ai huy luu and yogesh tulsi 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",17-11-2019 11:12,Reddit,377a,0

"the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented ."," the moe vs . trans debate has nothing to do with culture wars 2 feb 2021 top image still from video speaking in parliament on monday , education minister lawrence wong said that schools can be flexible in making arrangements for students with gender dysphoria , and that our main focus is continuing to provide them with a conducive learning environment and to support their overall well being . he also added that issues of gender identity have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies , and that we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . this is the first time the issue has been addressed in parliament since a trans student , identified as ashlee , claimed that moe had interfered with her hormone replacement therapy on reddit . she also said her school threatened to expel her over it as well . following this , 5 individuals protested outside the moe building last week . in parliament , wong addressed and validated the challenging experiences of students with gender dysphoria , which is a step towards opening conversations on the matter . but by claiming that western gender issues could potentially divide our society , attention was directed towards vague forces rather than on placing accountability on key players in ashlee s story . everything about the debate is singaporean let s look at the claims made and the parties involved in the ashlee vs . moe debacle a singaporean trans student alleges that a singaporean government institution moe interferes with her medical treatment for gender dysphoria , which was diagnosed by imh , another public singaporean institution , while her local singaporean school threatens to expel her over it . every party involved is either a singaporean or a singaporean institution . from ashlee s lived experience in her school as a trans student , to the bodies involved in granting her transition , it is difficult to pinpoint any culture war , let alone western influence at play . don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery . ashlee s grievances were rooted in trying to maneuver the often hostile path to accessing medical treatment for gender dysphoria as a student . for example , she claimed that before commencing hormone therapy , her psychiatrist was told by moe that they needed to be consulted before treatment could proceed , and that to date , no approval letter had come . she also said that her school called for a meeting with her father , where she was told she would be expelled if any physiological changes from hormone therapy would result in her being unable to wear the boys uniform . ashlee s case is about medical and education policy in singapore . trying to blame or pinpoint western forces or ideologies is a distraction , as it does little to help us unpack why the gap in guidelines came to be , and how it can be rectified . the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented . if anything , comments about a culture war may only spark one where it doesn t exist . why are we still talking about ashlee s story ? the reason why students protested outside moe last week and why netizens continue to discuss ashlee s story is because no definite conclusion has come of her case , not because of an ideological debate . if you look at discourse online and even the comments under her most recent post on reddit , netizens don t seem to be so concerned with whether being trans or undergoing hormone therapy is right or wrong , but rather , with picking apart the claims made on both sides . no official investigation has been launched , and while moe refutes the students claims , the public has been given no definitive answer about how the situation was handled . one voice that remains surprisingly silent in this time is that of ashlee s doctor , who could instantly help clarify the matter and put an end to online speculation . so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society . share with us your thoughts on this story at community . co . if you haven t already , follow rice on instagram , spotify , facebook , and telegram . author edoardo liotta 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",02-02-2021 17:51,Reddit,gender dysphoria,1

"it would be very unwise for the government to repeal section 377a until and unless there are robust safeguards in place , especially for the sake of our children .","section 377a of the penal code , which criminalises acts of gross indecency between males in public or private , is one of the most controversial topics in singapore today . some consider the law to be outdated and discriminatory against people who identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq , et cetera . others who favour retaining section 377a consider the law to be a critical symbol of singapore s mainstream values on marriage and family , as well as sexuality and gender . apart from law and policy , the debate also has implications on a wider question of social harmony how can people with vastly differing viewpoints coexist side by side in singapore society , without resulting in clashes or conflicts over deeply held values ? with these issues in mind , we consider what the best way forward is . since we started reading and writing about this matter , we have realised that children and youth are the most vulnerable in this great tussle of value systems . foreign news reports tell of young children being made to learn that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , that gender confusion an often conflicting and painful experience is not just normal , but should be celebrated and accompanied by irreversible treatment from a very young age . these practices may be harmful to children . for example , sweden has largely banned the use of puberty blockers to treat gender confused children , owing to harmful side effects , and the united states authorities have recently warned of side effects such as symptoms of brain swelling . children are also taught that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , and encouraged to be sexually experimental since all sexual behaviours are equal , despite the science showing that some behaviours are riskier than others . in singapore , we already have local examples of school going children encouraged to use gender pronouns in controversial ways and young teenagers identifying as pansexual and the alienating or bullying of those who disagree . marriage , family , children and societal values so what has repealing section 377a to do with this ? as the only law that retains a distinction between heterosexual and homosexual behaviours , its existence , on principle , restrains advancing lgbtq activism that contributes to a hyper sexualised environment and a disproportionate focus on sexual and gender identities . its non enforcement allows our fellow lgbtq citizens to engage in such sexual behaviours without government intervention . but many activists have made clear their intent to go beyond repeal and push for , among other things , same sex marriage and controversial sexuality education . however , to have fruitful and honest public debate on these other issues , it is crucial for those with contrary views to resist strong international pressure such as through diversity policies in global multinational corporations and the immense intimidation on social media . if section 377a is repealed , the ground will only become further divided and civil dialogue harder to achieve . activists have called the threat to family a myth , saying that the repeal will not cause a breakdown of marriage in terms of divorces . however , while existing individual marriages may not break down , marriage and family as social institutions with public importance will be affected . it is critical that social policy continues to prioritise the best interests of children , whenever possible . decades of social science show that the best conditions to raise a child are when the child grows up in a healthy family with both a biological father and mother , who are in a stable and lasting marriage . at the level of state wide policies , if the traditional family unit is weakened , society will be weakened as well , with implications for social policy , welfare spending and criminal justice . we know how important it is to give children good homes to thrive in , and to involve both fathers and mothers in their children s lives because each plays a unique and complementary role in the parenting of their children . thus , one of us founded dads for life to reduce the adverse impact of fatherlessness including physically or emotionally absent or abusive fathers on children . the other continued his work in designing and delivering highly customised marriage and family development programmes for families at various stages of their life cycles , including helping former convicts to reintegrate into their families and society , as well as being a chief juror for an annual exemplary fathers award , which has gone a long way to inspire fathers in the community . on the other hand , in a same sex household , a child loses a connection with either a father or a mother . given that half of a child s dna comes from the father , and the other half comes from the mother , to say that two fathers or two mothers make no difference to the child is to put adults desires before the needs and rights of the child . this is on top of the ethical difficulties surrounding the ways in which same sex couples obtain children such as surrogacy , which objectifies children , and women who are surrogates . if there is no proper consideration of all these possible negative effects of same sex marriages and family , we put children at risk by entering uncharted territory at the level of public policy . the existing status quo on section 377a is based on a careful balance and a political compromise adopted by parliament in 2007 following an extensive debate . this political package to use the words of our apex court already achieves a precious and well thought out balance . it ensures that the norms and values on marriage and family will remain mainstream , while giving space for lgbtq people to live freely and contribute to society . best way forward seeing how the repeal of section 377a can have a far wider and deeper impact on our policies relating to family and children than we realise , what is the best way forward ? who should we be most concerned about ? the repeal of section 377a does not just affect the definition of marriage , but also has repercussions on the well being of children . therefore , children should be the first priority . and we believe the majority will agree . since children develop best in a stable family with their married biological parents , we should try our very best to promote and protect such a family structure . we recognise that society is imperfect and families are imperfect , but that does not mean we should not strive towards the ideal in public policies , while offering support to others who already find themselves in imperfect conditions . we must do everything we can to protect our children , and we strongly recommend the following enshrine man woman marriage in our constitution , to show how we cherish the time tested value of the natural family unit as a nation , and to protect against any attempt to redefine it . having it enshrined in the constitution the highest law of the land will ensure that it is protected for the long term , it can be amended only by a two thirds majority of parliament , and man woman marriage has the highest priority in law and policy . enshrining man woman marriage in our constitution is insufficient to protect children from being indoctrinated with controversial and age inappropriate ideas and beliefs on sexuality . to better protect children , we must enact new legislation . this ensures that all other related policies , for example , guidelines on media codes and sex education in schools , can take reference from this new legislation the way it is being done now , with section 377a maintaining the distinction between homosexual and heterosexual relations . alternatively , the same effect can be achieved by keeping section 377a , given that the provision has already been vigorously debated in parliament , with the stance taken that it would not be proactively enforced . if section 377a is to be amended at all , a possible amendment might be to remove the words in private . if this is done , traditional marriage and legislation relating to children must be in place . it must also be made clear that the section is retained in the amended form as an important signal as to the norm of heterosexual relations . we would like to stress that this is not about discriminating against those who identify as lgbtq . we further denounce any threats of harm to those in the community . disagreeing with certain ideas is not discrimination . the debate over section 377a is about much more than the repeal of a provision that is not being proactively enforced . more importantly , it concerns the well being of our children and our nation . it would be very unwise for the government to repeal section 377a until and unless there are robust safeguards in place , especially for the sake of our children . singapore is at a unique juncture in time , at which it can chart its own course that avoids the polarisation over lgbtq issues that has divided many societies in the west , maintain the commitment to family values that have helped singapore to thrive , and allow space for different groups to contribute to society . the current precious and careful balance has served singapore well , and we should decide wisely as we consider the best way forward on section 377a . jason wong is a former senior civil servant , and the founder of the yellow ribbon project and the dads for life movement . mohd khair is a local and regional trainer and consultant who has helped many parents , youth and families through designing , developing and delivering highly interactive training programmes for more than two decades . both organised the recent protect singapore townhall event to discuss the impact of repealing section 377a of the penal code . the views expressed here are in their personal capacity .

"there have been several legal challenges mounted against section 377a , though they have been unsuccessful .","the government is considering how best to balance ground feedback that gay sex should not be criminalised with the desire for singapore s current position on marriage to be retained . speaking to reporters on saturday july 30 , law and home affairs minister k . shanmugam said the government has had extensive discussions with different people on section 377a of the penal code . under this section , it is a crime for a man , whether in public or in private , to commit any act of gross indecency with another man , and carries a jail term of up to two years . but the law is not actively enforced and it is a position that has been reiterated by the authorities since it was discussed robustly in parliament in 2007 . mr shanmugam said the discussions have included religious leaders such as taoists , christians , muslims and hindus , grassroots leaders , singaporeans from different backgrounds , lgbt lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender groups , and others . many agree that men who have sex with each other should not be thrown into prison . gay sex should not be criminalised , he said . at the same time , most do not want any decriminalisation to cause other major changes . in particular , most people want the current position on marriage to be retained . the current position is that the law defines marriage as being between a man and a woman . people don t want that to change , said mr shanmugam . people also do not want any change to the current policies that take reference from this definition of marriage , he added . the government understands this view . we are now considering how best to achieve this balance . the two questions we are dealing with are therefore one , what is to be done with 377a and two , at the same time , we are also considering how we can safeguard the current legal position on marriage from legal challenges in courts so that it does not get challenged in the courts , like 377a was in a series of cases , he said . these matters ought to be discussed in parliament , and decided in parliament , and not decided in the courts , he added . speaking to reporters at the tzu chi humanistic youth centre on the sidelines of community events , mr shanmugam also urged people here to avoid taking extreme positions on the issue , and to work out differences calmly for the sake of the country . there have been several legal challenges mounted against section 377a , though they have been unsuccessful . in february this year , the court of appeal through a five judge panel , dismissed challenges brought by three men who argued that section 377a should be struck down . it ruled that section 377a will stay on the books but cannot be used to prosecute men for having gay sex . mr shanmugam was also asked about a recent town hall that called for section 377a to remain on the books until there are guarantees to protect the traditional definition of marriage and family . mr shanmugam urged moderation from both sides and to avoid extreme positions and demands . he said these events illustrate what the government has been saying for a long time that if one side pushes too hard , then there will be pushback . we have seen this happen in many countries . if it happens here in singapore , and we are a very small place , the ruptures will tear our social fabric apart , cause a lot of harm , he said . this is why the government has been advocating moderation , moving carefully , and not to push positions which can damage society , he added . passions can run high , people genuinely believe in one or another view with great intensity . we have to try and deal with issues with an open mind , open heart . avoid extreme positions and avoid extreme demands , said mr shanmugam . move forward and try and be united , work on our differences in a calm way , for the sake of singapore . https www . straitstimes . com singap . . . without comprising legal position on marriage",30-07-2022 00:00,Hardware Zone,377a,0

"the issue of whether to repeal section 377a of the penal code does not meet the very high bar for a nationwide referendum , said deputy prime minister and finance minister lawrence wong on monday aug 22 .","the issue of whether to repeal section 377a of the penal code does not meet the very high bar for a nationwide referendum , said deputy prime minister and finance minister lawrence wong on monday aug 22 . mr wong was speaking to cna a day after prime minister lee hsien loong announced that the government will repeal the colonial era law that criminalises sex between men . in his national day rally speech , mr lee described the move as the right thing to do , but added that the constitution will be amended to protect the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman to prevent legal challenges . the decision comes months after the court of appeal dismissed the latest challenges to section 377a , reaffirming that the law was unenforceable in its entirety until the attorney general of the day indicates a change in the prosecutorial policy . following the ruling , authorities held extensive discussions with religious leaders , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt groups , as well as singaporeans on the best way forward on the law . asked why the option of a referendum was not considered , mr wong said it is stated in the constitution that a referendum is required only when sovereignty is at stake . singapore has held only one national referendum so far , in 1962 when singaporeans voted on the merger with malaya . the bar for a referendum is set very high and repealing 377a is very far from reaching this bar , said mr wong . because we are repealing a law which the courts have already said we cannot enforce . and even as we go about repealing the law , we are taking steps to ensure that the current family and social norms do not change . so we believe this certainly does not meet the bar for a referendum . mr wong noted that a referendum may not necessarily provide a resolution on sensitive issues . citing britain s brexit vote in 2016 and scotland s independence referendum in 2014 , he said far from resolving the issue , finding closure and moving forward , these referendums have deepened divisions in their societies . still , the move to repeal section 377a has generated different responses and whether this may see the government paying a political price , mr wong replied that the government understands it can t please everyone all of the time and is focused instead on doing what is right . in this case , we are trying to do a limited , controlled repeal of 377a and to achieve a new balance that reflects societal attitudes while preserving unity , he said . we are limiting the change to what we believe most singaporeans will accept , which is to decriminalise sexual relations between consenting adults in private at the same time , we are retaining and upholding what most singaporeans want , which is to uphold our current family and social norms . so , we believe this package is the right balance to strike , the minister told cna . mr wong acknowledged that not everyone will be happy with the announcement , with some preferring authorities to move more on this matter , while others thinking that the government is going too far . but in the end , the government has to make a judgment and do what we believe is right for the wider good of singapore and singaporeans , he said . and i would say that in a society like ours where there are diverse and sometimes opposing views , it is not possible for any single group to have everything that they want . we have to learn to compromise , to arrive at solutions where most people are comfortable with and live harmoniously together , he added , describing this as the singapore way to deal with sensitive issues . no change to national policies mr wong also told cna that the government is fully committed to upholding family centred policies . the prime minister himself said this very clearly in his speech the pap people s action party government will not change the current definition of marriage . this will not happen under the watch of the current prime minister , and it will not happen under my watch if pap were to win the next general election , he said . likewise , the impending repeal of section 377a will not change national policies that rely on the current definition of marriage , such as public housing , education , adoption rules , advertising standards and film classification . earlier on monday , the ministry of communications and information said lgbt media content will continue to warrant higher age ratings . separately , the ministry of education said education policies and school curriculums here will remain anchored on singapore s prevailing family values and social norms . basically , the overall tone of our society will not change , said mr wong . the minister noted that beyond changes in laws and policies , there are also some concerns about the excesses of activism and advocacy from both pro and anti lgbt groups . some have given us feedback that they have been subject to discrimination , or even been harassed when they speak out and when they practice their faith and beliefs , he added . the government is monitoring this very closely and will take action against any acts of discrimination or harassment , mr wong said , stressing that there is no place for such behaviours in singapore . no one should feel threatened because of their religious affiliation . no one should feel threatened because they are lgbt . he urged people to exercise restraint and tolerance on this issue which he described as one where people feel a lot of emotions about . if one side were to push too hard , the other side will push back even harder , and we will end up splitting our society , the minister added . let us instead find ways to come together . learn to compromise , accommodate each other , focus on the common ground which we share , which is significant and continue to work at building an ever more cohesive and united society . the prime minister said on sunday that there will be a full debate on the matter when legislation is brought to parliament . given how this is a matter of public policy , the pap does not intend to lift the whip when the issue is debated in parliament , said mr wong when asked . the singapore parliament website described the party whip as the disciplinarian of a political party . the whip ensures that there are sufficient party members in the chamber to support the party s position and that members of parliament vote according to the party s line . occasionally , he may lift the whip and allow mps to vote according to their conscience , the website said . dr janil puthucheary , senior minister of state for health and communications and information , is the current government whip . even as we were to repeal this law , we are making sure that we are putting in place measures to make sure that it will not trigger further societal changes , mr wong said . from that point of view , this is really a matter of public policy , and we do not intend to lift the whip when this matter is debated in parliament later on .

"therefore , modern day christian intolerance of homosexuality is precisely that intolerance .","i have addressed this point in my previous thread on this subreddit , and i am repeating my response here what you consider correct and original interpretation of scripture is actually not a pure interpretation , but one that is based on the cultural mores of your time . why are there female pastors in the modern church even though the bible explicitly says they are not allowed to have authority over men ? scripture is reinterpreted because what is considered right and just also changes with time . yes , i am aware that modern christianity justifies the appointment of female pastors by arguing that 1 tim 2 is written for a specific cultural context . however , cultural context is not the reason paul forbids it the verses after tell us that i do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man she must be quiet . for adam was formed first , then eve . and adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner . 1 tim 2 12 14 to arrive at the conclusion that cultural context was the only thing holding women back from preaching , you d have to wilfully read against the immediate evidence that the text presents , which is that women cannot preach because women caused the fall of humanity . therefore , scriptural interpretation is never pure , but is always mediated by the social mores of the interpreter . to arrive at the contextual argument you pointed out , wouldn t the interpreter have to purposely ignore paul s justification that women aren t allowed to teach because eve led adam astray ? paul doesn t mention poorly educated women to arrive at that conclusion , wouldn t the interpreter have to look beyond the text ? therefore , the idea that interpretation is solely based on the text is suspect . therefore , the existence of female pastors is justified through revisionist readings of the new testament . by the same logic , one should be able to re read the bible in a way that permits same sex sexual acts . after all , our modern day context is one that is strongly supported by scientific studies that show homosexuality is normal , involuntary and harmless . therefore , modern day christian intolerance of homosexuality is precisely that intolerance . they could re read the bible to allow it , but they don t want to .

and we ll see how just insane it looks . and then we ll use your response to his made up comment , just to see how stupid it is . so you can see what it actually looks like from someone who lives in near norway to read this drivel . asian countries aren t all that great either . singapore s health care system is notably transphobic . all countries have their faults . . . . no matter what wikipedia and their sources say about how great singapore is when it comes to trans rights , what the trans community says themselves is entirely different . i am not sure if you ll find any english sources on this , but anyone who knows anything about trans rights in singapore knows that a lot of trans people have been refused by the public healthcare system , and those that are allowed to be treated by their strict standards tell horror stories about how horrible they ve been treated by the doctors at the only public hospital in the entire country that offers treatment . which basically means they can do whatever they want because the patients can t go anywhere else , including breaking laws . there is an ongoing protest that is trying to get the attention of the government , but so far no luck . . . . you are making wild assumptions and accusations about me that are incorrect , unwarranted and unfounded . seeing as you are a random person on the internet i didn t want to assume what languages you know besides english , and since i don t have any sources on this topic in english afaik no newspapers have picked up the story i didn t share any . the wikipedia article you shared doesn t have a lot of information , and the information it does have is very one sided with almost exclusively positive opinions . knowing differently about what it s actually like to be queer in singapore i can say that it s missing a lot of information . i mean . . . the guy doesn t speak norweigan . lives in singapore . but he knows what it s like being queer in norway ? please . meanwhile , my sister is married to a trans , and we live in sweden . and i ve unloaded so much data , if this was a porn , it d be a bukkakke fest . but no , the data can be ranked differently , and it s easier to trust a fellow singaporean in front of someone who , you know , actually lives in the country they re making claims about , right ? sigh . . . now imagine you defending with , here are some data and rankings showing that singapore is in fact not that bad . let s paste your reply here , then such rankings are based on multiple factors , such that a country could be great with lgbt rights but suck on trans healthcare . do you see how insane this reasoning is ? i hope comparing this phraseology , format of the comments , and context toward singapore , would allow you to see how insane it looks like when a foreigner are making unbased claims about their country . this sub is so xenophobic , and your attempt at rationalizing his xenophobic dog whistling is some next level idiocy . tell me that you can see how insane the other commenter looks when reading his comments after i ve merely exchanged norway to singapore i really need to know that at least one singapore guy in this exchange was not completely brain dead . in addition , he is the one making one heck of a claim , without any sources , but here i am being pressured and told my sources aren t good enough . what the actual fuck ! so if i say singapore is a shit hole , you re going to find a source of how it isn t before you engage in a discussion with me about it ? or are you just going to ask me for source ? like damn . it s also super hilarious that he says it seems your wiki article is rather one sided . . . yeah ! norway is literally one of the best countries in the world when it comes to trans rights , even according to trans communities themselves ! of fucking course it s one sided ! that s like going to the red crosses homepage and saying don t know if we can trust their philantrophic record , it s sort of one sided , no shit you idiot !

you are hate filled because you insist that trans women are men despite being told over months and provided multiple research papers that proved contrary .,"as lifted from another redditor scientists and public health officials agree that trans men and women , and nonbinary people are who they say they are . gender is separate from sex and has to do with cultural norms based on sex , meaning that sex , not gender , is assigned at birth . gender derives its meaning from the society in which one lives , meaning gender is a social construct . it should also be remembered that in many cultures and parts of the world that there are people who do not have any issue with being trans nonbinary , most notably many native american cultures allow a third gender commonly referred to as two spirit . sex refers to dna and what body parts a person has , however , just like gender sex is not binary . there are instances where a person is born with parts that suggest they re female and parts suggesting they re male . this is called intersex . the ancient greeks were right . additionally , chromosomes don t always determine a person s sex . there are also several organizations and government agencies that support the validity of being transgender , which include but are not limited to the american medical association , britain s national health service , and the world health organization . https www . politifact . com article 2021 mar 04 what equality act debate gets wrong about gender s https www . nhs . uk live well healthy body trans teenager https www . ihs . gov lgbt health twospirit https www . britannica . com topic hermaphroditus https www . lambdalegal . org sites default files publications downloads resource trans professional statements 09 18 2018 . pdf https time . com 5596845 world health organization transgender identity and if it is not medical consensus , why are hospitals even in singapore providing transitioning resources ? so now i m upgraded from transphobia to attacking trans women and hate filled just because i do not think that trans women and biological women are the same . strawman . you are hate filled because you insist that trans women are men despite being told over months and provided multiple research papers that proved contrary . at this point , you are being willfully ignorant and happily doing something that you know contributes to the high suicide rate of trans people . if that is not hate filled , i don t know what is . no , i don t hate trans . i think you are different but you are not a woman . do go on pretending to be a woman , just stop forcing your worldview on the rest of us . and yet , you force your worldview on us despite so many scientific articles and medical journals supporting our existence . how ironic . or is it only your worldview is accepted ? and that we should all be happy to suck it up and have less legal rights because of how you feel despite science disagreeing ?

you assert that the distinction i made between using the rationale to justify why homosexual conduct should be illegal and why the law should be upheld is illusory .,"you seem very angry , which is unfortunate for you . the use of bold text is particularly interesting . i will try to address your rather lengthy response in as straightforward a manner as possible , though judging by your tone , i suspect it may be futile . 1 . your first point is that my statement is inaccurate because it is not what the judge meant . my statement is not intended to convey what the judge meant , but rather the logical conclusion that follows from what the judge held . as you know if you read a lot of case law or practice law , a legal holding has precedential value . as a result , even judges with the best of intentions can deliver judgments that have terrible consequences when applied to different fact patterns or even very similar fact patterns in subsequent cases . using the argument that it is inevitable that classification will product inequality in varying degrees and that this does not contradict the principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the law as long as all persons in like situations are treated alike to justify upholding a law that makes homosexual conduct criminal opens the door to using the same logic to uphold other laws which criminalize the behavior of or otherwise discriminate against a group of people . this is not inherently wrong . for example , i support laws that criminalize pedophilia . an obvious distinction there is the harm resulting from the conduct . however , using the principle that some forms of discrimination by the state are necessary for the public good to uphold the law in question establishes a dangerous precedent that can be used to justify other equally arbitrary uses of the state s power to discriminate . it is not inconceivable that this holding could be used as support for an argument that a different law that adversely affects people of a particular race or national origin is a legitimate use of the state s power to discriminate . your example it s ok to stop malays having children so long as you apply this equally to all malays is actually a fantastic example of my point and i thank you for that . i am glad to hear that you believe that this is so outlandish that it would never be upheld . however , i am not as confident as you are . if singapore were to experience an extreme disparity in malay population growth and were to enact a one child policy that only applies to malays , i do not think it is inconceivable that the holding in this case could be used to support upholding that law against a constitutional challenge though hopefully the challenge would prevail . 2 . you asked why i left out race in my response . i left it out because i was responding to your statement that s aying that justice loh used the quoted rationale to justify why male homosexuality ought to remain illegal is inaccurate , which doesn t address my original comment concerning race . see 1 above for why race is relevant . 3 . you assert that the distinction i made between using the rationale to justify why homosexual conduct should be illegal and why the law should be upheld is illusory . that seems a bit disingenuous on your part given your understanding of the case but , in any case , i disagree . the point of my response was to establish that contrary to your assertion , i was not stating that the judge is saying homosexual conduct should be illegal because the state has the power to discriminate in certain cases as you effectively attributed to me , but rather that a validly enacted law that makes homosexual conduct illegal should not be struck down based on article 12 because the state has the power to discriminate in certain cases . there is a quite significant distinction between a judge dictating what the law should be and a judge dictating what laws may be upheld . contrary to your assertion , this is a distinction very often used by both lawyers and judges . i think the tone of your response is pretty over the top and borderline belligerent . as you said , we do not appear to disagree at a macro level , so consider taking it down a notch . i do not know you and i am not making any assumptions about you so i would appreciate the same courtesy .

"article repost slightly more than half or 55 per cent of singaporeans still support section 377a of the penal code , even as one in three singaporeans is more accepting of same sex relationships than he or she was five years ago , a new survey has found .","article repost slightly more than half or 55 per cent of singaporeans still support section 377a of the penal code , even as one in three singaporeans is more accepting of same sex relationships than he or she was five years ago , a new survey has found . the online survey by ipsos public affairs , an independent market research company , was conducted over a period of four days from end july to early august 2018 to understand the current social attitudes towards same sex relationships . a total of 750 singaporean citizens and permanent residents aged 15 to 65 took part in the study . when asked the extent to which they supported or opposed section 377a of the penal code , which is the law that criminalises consensual sex between adult men , more than half 55 per cent indicated that they supported it , while 12 per cent said they opposed it . sentiment varied according to gender , with males more likely to strongly support the law than females . singaporeans aged 15 to 24 were more likely to oppose the law , while singaporeans aged 55 to 65 were more likely to support it . singaporeans were also asked the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the statement i believe that singaporeans should be able to participate in same sex relationships . twenty eight per cent agreed with the statement , while 38 per cent did not . a 2014 survey of more than 4 , 000 singapore residents conducted by the institute of policy studies similarly found that singaporeans are largely conservative . in the study , 78 . 2 per cent of respondents said that same sex relationships were wrong , while 72 . 9 per cent were not in favour of gay marriage . however , 33 per cent of singaporeans in the ipsos study agreed with the statement i am more accepting of same sex relationships than i was five years ago , while 35 per cent disagreed . the survey results come as the question of whether the law would be repealed in singapore was raised after the indian supreme court struck down a similar section of the indian penal code last thursday sept 6 . since then , online petitions to keep it and repeal it have been started by separate groups of individuals . when asked about the indian ruling last friday , law and home affairs minister k . shanmugam said in singapore if you look at this issue , it is a deeply split society . the majority are opposed to any change to section 377a , they are opposed to removing it . however , he said a growing minority want to have it repealed . the government is in the middle , he added . last saturday , he said that whether section 377a will be repealed or amended will be a matter for parliament to decide . he added that depending on the legislation , public opinion is often relevant during policymaking in parliament . ipsos said the findings indicate that attitudes towards the issue of same sex relationships have changed and are likely to continue to change , albeit at a slow pace . this change was attributed to perceptions of shifts in singapore s social norms with respect to same sex relationships , increased conversations on social media and more direct exposure to same sex relationships . said ipsos associate research director robert mcphedran this research indicates that the normative values of singaporeans with respect to lgbtq lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer issues are gradually shifting . he added as has occurred in other countries globally , increased dialogue regarding same sex relationships has contributed to higher acceptance among singaporeans . this is particularly the case for the younger generation . nonetheless , as pm lee has previously noted , a social consensus remains far from being reached .

imagine 2 christians one vehemently against homosexuality and same sex marriage .," traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . again , this goes back to the problems of proposing that marriage should be measured by its reproduction potential . let me quote myself again marriage cannot be defined by its reproduction potential . if so , then thousands of heterosexual couples without children should not be allowed to marry . there are also countless heterosexual couples who plan to never have kids . do we ban them from marrying as well ? under the same logic , people who are infertile or above the age of child bearing should not be allowed to marry too , since reproduction is out of the question . also , in singapore s context , malay families traditionally have more children than non malay ones . given your reference , are you suggesting that malay marriages are superior to non malay ones because they are more ordered toward procreation ? you cannot keep redefining marriage to suit your narrative . marriage has never been about reproduction hetero sex is , and even that isn t its only purpose . marriage is about love and commitment between two persons . are you going to suggest that there be a law that bans all sexual activity which does not result in conception ? one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . again , i can bring up countless studies and examples if you wish to know more . countless books have been written by the children of same sex couples . in fact , same sex couples are a lot more involved in parenting . i have never heard of a same sex parent who hasn t read at least one book on parenting . have you read any books on parenting ? my parents have never done that . they probably don t even know books on parenting exist . are you saying my family did not provide the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of me ? because that s what you re saying . it imposes its acceptance on all society . this is a common fear among those who oppose equality , so i d like to bring some attention to it . no , it doesn t impose anything on you or me , for that matter . even when same sex marriage is legal , i will still find it icky . i will still let my sons know that pussies are more fun not sure what i ll do with daughters , honestly . legalizing it does not force you to accept it . if you have a problem with it , you can still express it . you can still preach against it in churches and mosques . you can stop your children from having gay friends or friends with gay parents , and you can still tell them how immoral and wrong it is . you can even refuse to make wedding cakes or take wedding photos for them . there is pretty much nothing you need to do to accept same sex marriages . by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . on the same stroke , by banning same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active discriminator . by banning same sex marriage , the state is saying these people are less of a human because marriage is for normal human beings only . should the state be able to do that ? should we allow the state to determine that a gay person is less of a human ? . . . punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . sorry to break your bubble , but this part of the article does not apply to singapore . we already have anti discriminatory laws at the work place . state employees who expresses beyond just personal disapproval will already be punished . same for expressions against gender , race , and religion . try going to your work place and announce i do not want to work with these women because women are stupid and see what happens . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences . . . i am not a christian . i am a straight man who believes , strongly , about equality and the benefits of a more equitable society . are you saying i am not a person of good will ? because that s what you re saying . are you saying i m betraying my conscience ? because that s what you re saying . also , if you do not want others to attack your christian morality , why do you , then , insist on attacking our non christian morality ? why do you expect homosexuals to betray their conscience ? why do you want to silence them ? gays are not forcing christians to stop practicing and believing in their faiths . no single gay person is saying there should be a ban on churches and jesus , in the name of homosexuality . why are you trying to impose your belief on others by using the law , in the name of christianity ? this , in essence , is the complete immorality of your position , which brings me to the point about your religion it offends god first , let me just ask the rhetorical question how do you know ? are you god ? second , as an atheist , and millions like me , and millions more who are non christians , we reject your god , either in its meaning , its existence , or both . you may not impose it on us with the law , because the law does not belong to you . but that s the beauty of it , because similarly , we cannot use the law to ban christianity , or ban you from practicing your faith , no matter how much some of us would like to . third , what about the fact that your god wants you to treat every man as his brother , and that you must never judge as only god can judge , and that god loves everybody ? imagine 2 christians one vehemently against homosexuality and same sex marriage . the other who accepts and loves everybody , including gays , as equal . each professes their actions in the name of god . who is right ? who s wrong ? do i throw them a couple of knives and let them fight it out , and accept the answer of the one who wins ? that is your dilemma . the interpretation of religion is , in and of itself , subjective . you may not subject your subjective interpretation of morality onto the rest of the population using the law , because that s what slave owners did . that is far more immoral than anything you have conjured up against same sex equality .

this reduced discrimination is certainly going to be better for their mental health .," so explain to me , how many lgbtq teens have committed suicide here in singapore ? any numbers ? people already are committing suicide here for other reasons than their sexuality . shouldn t they take more precedence ? you re making a false argument that we can only help one group of people . here s the reality removing 377a and allowing for same sex marriage would go a long way in making the lgbt community feel less discriminated against . this reduced discrimination is certainly going to be better for their mental health . given the 7 is a drop , but the rates are still higher because people still stigmatize them ? really ? yes . homophobia , while lessened , certainly still exists in the us . even the article isn t so bold as to state its all discrimination and they couldn t find any other factors . hooker administered three projective tests the rorschach , thematic apperception test tat , and make a picture story maps test to 30 homosexual males and 30 heterosexual males recruited through community organizations . the two groups were matched for age , iq , and education . none of the men were in therapy at the time of the study . unaware of each subject s sexual orientation , two independent rorschach experts evaluated the men s overall adjustment using a 5 point scale . they classified two thirds of the heterosexuals and two thirds of the homosexuals in the three highest categories of adjustment . when asked to identify which rorschach protocols were obtained from homosexuals , the experts could not distinguish respondents sexual orientation at a level better than chance . a third expert used the tat and maps protocols to evaluate the psychological adjustment of the men . as with the rorschach responses , the adjustment ratings of the homosexuals and heterosexuals did not differ significantly . hooker concluded from her data that homosexuality is not a clinical entity and that homosexuality is not inherently associated with psychopathology . this study has since been repeated and the findings have consistently been the same . please educate yourself on the scientific literature before lecturing people about arguing on fact . http psychology . ucdavis . edu rainbow html facts mental health . html the us has far more conservatives than singapore for sure and discrimination racism is way more prevalent there because free speech is evil and we have anti sedition laws . no hate speech here . you seem highly misinformed . anti sedition laws don t apply to the lgbt community . case in point the waapd group on facebook . so remind me again , how is it being lgbtq being more oppressed in singapore than being in the us again ? 377a and the lack of same sex marriage ? it s rather obvious , no ?

maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a .,"we all know that any developed country outside of sea region and ccp does not criminalised people just becus they are specifically gendered male and have sex with each other . even india does not criminalise . thats blunt sense moronic , to criminalise something specifically based on gender . apologies if you disagree . even india moves on from the ruling many years back . the way you are putting it , its like just because other countries are doing it , we should do it too . so if other countries are abolishing or has already abolished death sentence for drug smugglers , we should blindly follow ? blind following the blind ? with out the independence of mind ? shoudn t the final outsome , even if it results in the abolishment of the act , be made with the indepencence of mind ? at least justifty your support for the abolishment of 377a with better logic . majority of these less developed sea countries will properly side ccp in the upcoming war . so you are really just associating your ideal values with them . since the early 2010s , honestly people all over the globe dont really anti male homo people anymore . why again are you mentioning about the ccp ? they are the only ones against abolishment of 377a like laws ? what about those states where gay sex is punishable by death . quite a few of them around . and they fare worse then ccp in terms of gay rights . but no mention of it from you . but just solely on ccp . i wonder why . we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war . so you are spilling over your dislike of ccp in regards to those matters to this ? if you really feel that homosexuality is immoral for the sake of so called moral values , you wouldn t even criminalise just male people , male people specifically were targeted because people who make these rules are mostly male people and are just over paranoid that without these laws and ruling , they themselves will turn homosexual . there is a term called homophobia , this is what you sound like more rather than people preaching good people values . the part in bold , that s one of the worst logic i ever heard . i mean serious ? can see you are no longer logical . not sure what you are smoking there . what next ? law makers are coming are with anti robbery laws because they are afraid they might become robbers themselves ? then they might as well not have the law and enjoy themselves by making it legal fulfilling their desires or tendencies legallly rather then fighting against their innate desires , why go through all the trouble ? as for the homesexuality part being immoral . not sure why you brought up the immoral part . a celibate homosexual is more moral than a promiscuous hetereosexual . a better way to put it is , its against nature rather then immoral . heterosexuality is part of human evolution in terms of the continuance of human population . not to mention , those body parts when in unison , were not mean to perform those task , which is why proportionally there is a higher risk of contracting stds , hiv , monkeypox , suffering from incontinence etc . in gays then heterosexuals . . because nature did not mean those body parts for that . which is why i support maintaining status quo not further tightening of the law . by that , i mean the law existing in name to permeate the state of mind that gay sex is discouraged , even though the act was no longer stricly enforced while not actually in most cases punishing gay sex itself . which is i believe the most popular sentiment among the general population excluding lgbts it would have been better to strengthen or come up protective laws against depriving gays , lgbts who are out of the closet , of job opportunities , etc . rather then repealing the act . problems is , there are people like you who like to jump to conclusions . not supporting the repealing of the act gays should be punished heavily or homophobia blah blah . of course i am not ruling out the existence of such people . but there are different schools of thought even among those who do not support the repealing of the act . some take a more aggressive stance , some take a more middle ground . regarding good values , you have good values because you support repealing of the act ? seems like quite a loose definition of good values if so . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . not sure if repealing of the act , but embedding the defintion of marriage only between man and women into the contsitution , making it not challengable in court is exactly boost the international image , attract more international investments that u define . maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . nah , i don t take it personally . hope you seriously don t too . i am also fine that you are the judge of howthose who dun support repealing of the act are , traditionalists , suck at justifying and challenging , and not being able to accept new norms . after all , delusional or not , your opinions and sentiments must be superior to those that contrast to you and it is the universal truth . and yes , i believe you are not even a pro homo person after reading your post which is not even actually pro homo .

"both polygamy and incest ought to be banned precisely because it is usually not between consenting adults , unlike homosexual relationships .","1 . laws shouldn t be based on moral values that everyone agrees with . that s just mob rule . there s a reason why we have legal scholars , philosophers and ethicists . there are people who are actually experts in deciding what should or should not be legal . 2 . slippery slope . polygamy and incest are wholly irrelevant to the debate . but since you asked , here is the answer . both polygamy and incest ought to be banned precisely because it is usually not between consenting adults , unlike homosexual relationships . if you actually read the literature on why incest should be banned , it s because the power dynamics at home make it difficult for some persons to actually refuse incestual relations . hence , it is difficult to say when someone legitimately consents to an incestuos relationship or when they have simply been coerced into one . the same thing occurs for polygamy . the structure of social norms surrounding marriage is still lopsided where husbands usually have more power in telling their wives what to do . hence , polygamy is not usually consensual between all parties . however , theres nothing morally wrong about polyamory if every party in the relationship agrees to it . do look it up . i have not seen any peer reviewed argument against polyamory . 3 . i agree with the last point . because 377a is not enforced , repealing it does nothing for gays . however , i am of the opinion that parliament should not be able to tell the ag when to enforce what laws . that s just crazy . ag should prosecute all the laws of the land , not cherry pick . that sets a very very bad precedent .

there is a fundamental difference between a church that teaches homosexuality is not wrong .,"your nazi analogy is flawed . firstly , there is a fundamental difference between catholics and protestants . the very reason why protestants exists is because they reject fundamental beliefs of the catholic church , protested against them hence the name and started their own church . to put it plaintly , there s no such thing as a nazi who believes jews are equal . such a person belongs to a completely different category . next , you re linking being gassed by nazis with acts against lgbt . well then , did the germans who are not nazis , those who actually love and accept the jews , gas the jews by association as well ? just because they are germans even though they hold completely different beliefs ? there is a fundamental difference between a church that teaches homosexuality is not wrong . do not discriminate . god made lgbtq people this way . love one another despite differences . and a church that teaches homosexuality is unnatural . god hates homosexuals . it is an illness that can be cured . there is a fundamental difference between a group that accepts lgbt people and a group that actively holds anti lgbt campaigns and conversion therapy . i m curious as to why you would call out the former , and go as far as to say you re not particularly interested in other groups . it s almost as if you don t have an issue with anti lgbt , and your intention is to propagate falsehoods about religion . furthermore , support for 377a isn t exactly anti lgbt . if that s the case then shouldn t you call it sexist because it only applies to men ? anti lgbt would be opposing pinkdot , an event that supports all lgbtq people . has the local catholic or angelican church engaged in opposing pinkdot ? have they engaged in the wear white movement ? have they engaged in conversion therapy ? are they , as you claim , the biggest group that are anti lgbt ? if yes , where are your sources ?

this reinforces my opinion that you have not met a trans person in real life .," you simply cannot choose to live as your transitioned gender without having undergone medical transition , and expect there to be zero consequences . question , what do you think is medical transition . because i have undergone hormone replacement therapy which causes the largest change in how i look , making me look no different from other women . the one you are focusing on is srs which does nothing to my external appearance and is only there for my genitals which nobody should be looking at even in the public toilet . if you choose to dress and live as a woman well in advance of your medical transition , then the difficulty you face during the interim period was of your own choosing , no ? why not continue to dress and live as a man before medical transition , and use the appropriate bathrooms in the meantime , saving yourself and others any of this discomfort ? this reinforces my opinion that you have not met a trans person in real life . you do not seem to realize that trans women boy mode early in their transition to avoid the discomfort both for themselves and others . yes , you then have to deal with your own internal difficulties of sexual identity etc . but that surely is still the more sensible and reasonable choice , rather than making a ulilateral decision to live as a woman well before the medical and legal transition has occurred . it is gender identity . and you seem to be associating it as a choice rather than a treatment for something that causes so much discomfort and pain that suicide is preferable for some compared to staying in the closet . regarding your question of trans men going to the female toilet yes , i would still support it as long as they are still legally and medically female . if they need to wave their ics around to do it , so be it . i d much rather that than leave the choice in their hands . so i guess that means you prefer someone like this https pbs . twimg . com profile images 1144302067940392960 hu1zme3j 400x400 . png to be in the female toilet ? do you think him being in the female toilet causes more or less discomfort to others using the same toilet ? from my conversation with you , it is pretty obvious that you have zero idea of what a trans person is or how they look like . so what makes you so sure of yourself that you insist on proposing things that will cause discomfort to every other person ? it feels like you are focused so much on legal gender marker that you forget how appearance and other factors affect the so called discomfort . perhaps you would like to try volunteering at organizations that work with trans people such as transbefrienders to find out more about what actual trans people are like and the actual bathroom situation instead of going by your own imagination ?

i m against repealing 377a because the government will force me and my children to be gay .,"saw this article and wanted to get this out of my system . the writer s arguments are anything but well thought out . they rely on fallacious arguments and non sequiturs . lets take a look from the very top . the government maintains a position that all religious communities are free to give voice to their conscience in matters that have moral impact . people of religious faith have equal right to be included in rather than dismissed from the public forum of debate . some homosexual rights advocates argue that religious citizens should refrain from arguing that the state laws should criminalise conduct that they consider immoral . this line of argument actually contradicts the definition of secularism . for what they are really saying is you shouldn t make laws based on your morality , but on mine instead . just because something is immoral to the religious i . e . a sin , doesn t mean it should be criminalised . for example , the bible raises all sorts of sins which no sane person would criminalise , such as wearing mixed cloth and worshipping other gods . on a broader point , singapore in a classical sense can never be called a pure secular state because it allows certain anomalies to exist 1 . independent schools both primary and secondary that are set up and run by religious groups e . g . acsi , sji . these schools are directly funded by the state 2 . islamic family courts system enacted in 1968 under the administration of muslim actadministers muslim personal law in legal matters governing marriages , divorces , the nullity of marriages and inheritance in singapore . 3 . the common law system underpinning our whole legal system is rooted in the judeo christian philosophical worldview . in the seventeenth century , sir matthew hale declared that the whole bible made up the common law of england . in 1767 , lord mansfield qualified this only slightly by declaring , the essential principles of revealed religion are part of the common law . oh we aren t really a secular state so we should just make our laws according to religious lines this guy . if personal enjoyment , consent , and commitment are all that is now required to declare a sexual behaviour legitimate , then there is no reasonable basis for withholding public recognition of polygamous polyamorous , adult brother sister unions or even adult adolescent unions . a quarter of the way in and this guy slippery slopes himself into legislating paedophilia , while conveniently forgetting the part where children can t consent . it is galling for singaporeans , who have seen their country progress so well to now be lectured by an elite group of liberals that they are intolerant bigots . for no other nation in human history , since empirical records have been kept , has advanced as quickly as the little island nation . despite having virtually no natural resources , singapore has gone from being a third world country in 1965 to a first world country in less than half a century . the world bank recorded that the gdp of singapore has grown 3700 from 1965 whereas the usa only grew 300 . children from the least privileged backgrounds have risen from great poverty to achieve remarkable success . acute poverty is now rare in singapore . other measures of success are equally impressive . infant mortality has been reduced faster than any other society in the last 50 years . students in singapore now top the charts consistently in international tests . for instance , the oecd ranked singaporean children number one in the world in a recent global rankingof universal basic skills in mathematics and science . yet we are told that we are backward and intolerant . economic progress ! social progress . when others call us backward and intolerant , they talk about our social policies and human rights . yet he harps on and on about things that are anything but that . this guy totally missed the point . singaporeans have made clear repeatedly that the vast majority oppose any attempts to remove s377a . this majority has likely grown over the last few decades with the growth of conservative religions , like christianity , in the wider population . for those who advocate repealing s377a we must ask what moral standards do you appeal to that will persuade us that society s current moral consensus is wrong ? if you can t persuade the majority , what gives you the right to declare by fiat that your moral code must supersede that of ours ? because the basic human rights of gays are being suppressed by these laws ? because their homesexuality does not harm others ? because we should uphold the rights of the minority , especially when said rights do not harm others ? the majority of people in singapore recognize that the homosexual lifestyle is harmful for the individual and society in general . statistics abound from all over the world to back up that statement with drug abuse , sexual transmitted diseases , depression , suicide rates disproportionately affecting those in the non heterosexual population . oh yeah , totally due to the the homosexual lifestyle , and totally not because we keep oppressing them . life expectancy is considerably lower . citation needed . this is found to be universally true even in societies where homosexuality is celebrated and encouraged . homosexuality leads to vastly inflated risks of physical and emotional harm to the individual . families and society at large are then often left to pick up the pieces of such a destructive lifestyle . . . . all the three great abrahamic religions are crystal clear that homosexuality is always a choice that can be rejected . society is replete with anecdotal evidence from both secular and religious people , who have turned their backs on the lifestyle . the weight of scientific evidence demonstrates that it is not innate or congenital , like skin colour , but rather an aspect of our freewill . the gay gene theory has been overwhelmingly debunked ! straight up lies right there . also , i m gonna call out the homosexuality is a choice thing , as it is proven bullshit . most singaporeans are suspicious that the repeal of s377a would unleash a range of thorny problems that would deeply disturb the fabric of our society . they have seen from the evidence to date in other countries that it leads to mandatory indoctrination of our children in the education system , gay adoption , gay marriage , discrimination against employees who morally disagree with the homosexual lifestyle , and flamboyant gay pride parades . some have even found themselves fined or imprisoned for opposing homosexual practice . in his 2007 speech in parliament that advocated retaining s377a , the current prime minister , mr lee hsien loong wisely noted that to change the law would result in the reality that gay activists will push for more . mr ho peng kee , then senior minister of state for home affairs in 2007 , also noted that there was an inherent danger in removing s377a . he pointed out , whilst homosexuals have a place in society , repealing section 377a will be very contentious and may send a wrong signal that government is encouraging and endorsing the homosexual lifestyle as part of our mainstream way of life . i m against repealing 377a because the government will force me and my children to be gay . this guy , basically . nothing has changed since 2007 , save for the fact that singaporeans have probably become even more religious . there is no objective evidence that the world is a better place for the diminishing of the traditional family unit as the central building block in any of these western societies . our society has prospered and developed at an incredible rate by maintaining our core family values . ah yes , if it ain t broke don t fix it . except that now we have homosexuals telling us that it is broke and for good reason . so maybe we should start on fixing it ? honestly , this guy s arguments are full of shit and reeks of intolerance . would not recommend 10 10 , 2 7 with rice .

it s even more egregious that this only affects male homosexual intercourse .,"let me try to answer from the perspective of a straight ally . sorry if this is vague and rambling . s377a makes male homosexual intercourse illegal . i personally feel that makes a travesty of the idea that we re based on the rule of law . either enforce it or address it . it s even more egregious that this only affects male homosexual intercourse . besides the legal inconsistencies , lgbt couples do not have the option to access anywhere near the same level of legal recognition straight couples do . why should an lgbt couple have any less legal recognition than a straight couple ? basically the standard argument the government has used to justify its keep it illegal but do not enforce strategy is that society is not ready . thus part of the point of publicising pinkdot is to show the authorities that lgbt people are just as much a normal part of society as anyone else , and that first , hopefully the legal inconsistency with s377a can be resolved , and after that more progress can be made to treat lgbt people equally like any other citizen . i m a married straight man , and my wife and i have attended pinkdot regularly because we don t think there s any reason why lgbt people should be denied the same rights we have , and that we , as the sort of nuclear family unit which the government portrays as the building blocks of our society are cool with it . as for the idea that if someone was lgbt they would already be aware of their community , unfortunately that s not true . a lot of lgbt youth and even adults can feel very isolated , and many may experience bullying etc . pinkdot is a highly publicised venue where resources can be advertised . for example , a shelter for homeless transgender people was advertising at pinkdot . someone who is transgender , and perhaps , may have been kicked out by their parents may well have had no idea about the presence of such resources if not for these highly centralised events which allow for information to be easily disseminated . in the end it comes down to empathy i think . as straight people , engaging with the lgbt community helps us to understand that they re just people like anyone else , and deserve the same respect . finally , in my personal case , as an ethnic minority i understand what it s like to feel alienated to an extent in my own society . i m not trying to play the race card here . my point is that ethnic minorities are legally protected in a way that the lgbt minority isn t . thus its important to me to demonstrate solidarity with people who have less recourse to legal protection than myself . didn t get to go this year as my wife is heavily pregnant and standing for hours in a crowd wasn t a good idea . we ll be going next year and taking the kids though . edit oh hey , gold , thanks kind stranger !

it is a promise that could easily be revoked for 377a .," as a guy , being able to achieve orgasm , also means that some degree of sexual gratification was achieved . let s say a skilful girl was able to give a homosexual guy an orgasm . it might not be as good as homosexual intercourse , but it s not zero . kevin durant publicly offered to drink scarlet johansson s bath water . he hasn t been successful thus far , going by public record . that doesn t mean that he s given up on sex with anyone else . umm . . orgasm does not mean sexual gratification . it is your body s response to stimuli usually at the erogenous regions but you can still orgasm without enjoying it . if i m talking about weed , then it s much easier being an advocate for 377a , than weed . since only one of them runs the risk of a jail term . it is a promise that could easily be revoked for 377a . take note that they had also used other laws to conduct anti gay operation with a recent one being done in 2010 . also , 377a has been reported https sacc . aware . org . sg get involved your stories to prevent male sexual assault victims from speaking up . so it s not even about a law that isn t enforced . but about everything else after . so even overturning the law wouldn t satisfy the lgbtq community . now i can see why those protect s pore people talk about a larger agenda . while the lgbtq movement says it only doesn t want to be treated as criminals . it is the symbol of the discrimination faced by lgbtq people . is equal rights really a larger agenda ? would you be happy to live with the exact same constraints as us ? perhaps you would like to try it and see why lgbtq people are unhappy with the status quo ? racial equality is mentioned in our pledge enshrined in our constitution . yet it obviously hasn t stopped racism . so even if 377a was struck down , societal acceptance might not necessarily follow . but it did result in a huge improvement where we no longer have such severe racial tensions that would have resulted in racial riots . although racism is not fully removed , it is still a huge step from the past . now science can be used to prove if something might be harmful . but i ve yet to heard about scientific experiments , used to show , if something is ethical or not . in fact , i think that making conversion therapy torturous guarantees failure . the idea is has to be about making it pleasurable . else how does one convert ? but i don t think such experiments are allowed , in this day and age . and how do you propose that ? if you are so certain that conversion therapy works , why not do it on yourself . open yourself to the possible trauma that you propose on inflicting on others ? apart from our legacy british penal code . the barriers you mentioned are there , because it has the complicit support of the majority . most people want a traditional nuclear family unit . while the government wants these units to produce more babies , thus the incentives given to do so . untrue . most of the complicit support are just apathy with some vocal groups bringing in bigotry from western influences . if we removed every single neutral voices , there is a bigger argument for the repeal of 377a . it s not all difficulties , without any benefits . the lack of children means that gay households have more disposable spending power . it s the power of the pink dollar , that brought one of the largest annual gay dance parties to sentosa , once upon a time . so you are saying that there are benefits to being discriminated against ? there are childless straight marriages as well . and they benefit given that they can bto whereas a gay couple intending to stay together will have to pay the extremely high price for a resale and be locked out of certain regions too . where is the increased disposable spending power ? also take note that there is discriminatory hiring which results in lgbtq citizens usually being forced to only get low paying jobs . is that a benefit ? and for pink dollar , the companies profit off of it whereas lgbtq people gain nothing from it . following this line , maybe the lgbtq community can strive to make more money . which will improve their lobbying power . money makes everything easier . it s something our policy makers take into account . perhaps if we do not face discrimination during job hunts ? where disclosing that you re lgbtq will not result in an instant rejection or not getting the chance of an interview ? and ultimately , i didn t write our laws . nor do i plan my day , around making the lgbtq community miserable . neither the larger public , who have bread butter issues to stress about . and yet you consistently argue against allowing lgbtq people equal rights . you have spent hours on a work day arguing for something that will make the lgbtq community miserable . you are also not the only one doing this . you may view yourself as being neutral but the fact is that you do have an interest in making lgbtq citizens miserable with your promotion of conversion therapy and argument against the repeal of 377a . how would straight couples appreciate more competition for their btos ? so we straight up don t deserve housing as singapore citizens ? we all pay the same taxes , we all contribute to singapore , we should all get the same rights and chances at btos . there are so many childfree straight couples who get btos . should we then insist that all of them forfeit their housing to couples that have children ? if you truly care about the finite resource of btos , combating flipping of hdbs and preventing people from having more than one house would probably do a lot more than barring lgbtq people from bto . anyway , i m more than happy . to put the issue to a public referendum . because you know that the bigots are still vocal and a huge percentage are apathetic enough to be happy with continuing discrimination . would you be happy if we have a public referendum regarding your rights ?

"conclusion from 10 and 11 , the government should not support a policy of legalising same sex marriage ."," something undemocratic for the greater bad your opinion of the greater bad , you mean . for national policy ? when s the last time that happened ? let s say , for example , singapore switches to nuclear energy for more sustainable , green energy as a matter of national policy . singapore then plans to shut down some other power plants like , say , tuas power plant , when the nuclear power plant is complete . residents of tuas are concerned about the impact this could cause for tuas . is it not perfectly right for mps representing the west coast grc to voice these concerns in parliament ? if you think this is not right , what is the alternative ? should the concerns of the residents simply be unrepresented ? feelings are not fact ah , now i see . your idea of objective is to completely ignore feelings . that s not very objective . many singaporeans like durians . liking durians is a subjective feeling , but the fact that people like durians is an objective fact . why would you ignore objective facts about subjective feelings ? they re not irrelevant . people act based on feelings , and those actions change the world . that is fact . the government has taken these objective facts about subjective feelings into account before . in 1972 , singapore notices that firecrackers are really dangerous , and wants to ban them . however , the people like firecrackers . the government takes into consideration this fact about people s feelings , and the solution is that while firecrackers are still banned , they hold a chingay parade to boost the festive spirit , so that the people feel more festive during chinese new year . is this an objective decision ? of course . in fact , you don t really oppose the government using objective facts about subjective feelings . you linked a whole number of website that say that singapore s sentiments about lgbt are becoming more favourable to the lgbt . isn t that a subjective feeling that people have ? if the government were to use this to justify allowing same sex marriage , wouldn t that be using an objective fact about singaporeans subjective feelings ? so , would that be an objective reason ? of course . this clean separation of feelings and facts is not practical . feelings influence behaviours , which shape the objective facts . fact based would involve providing data as to prove that singapore is indeed too crowded and has too many immigrants . define too crowded . define too many immigrants . this is a subjective standard . to a xenophobe , one immigrant is too many , to a globalist , there is no such thing as too many . let s try another example . there are parents who are concerned that education is too competitive , and causes too much stress on students . good luck objectively defining too competitive . or , suppose a cyclist thinks that singapore needs to increase the number of parking spaces for bicycles , because it is currently very inconvenient to park a bicycle . good luck objectively defining what very inconvenient is . politics are not just about facts . they are also greatly about what values a society should prioritise and promote . inevitably , opinions about this are highly subjective . if you don t think so , go objectively prove what makes something very inconvenient . give one argument against same sex marriage sure , how about this 1 . singapore has a strong cultural link between marriage and children . 2 . removing this strong cultural link between marriage and children will result in less people having children . 3 . due to 2 , a strong cultural link between marriage and children 4 . same sex couples cannot have any biological children with each other . 5 . because of 4 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage will damage the cultural link between marriage and children . 6 . from 2 and 5 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage will result in less people having children . 7 . singapore needs more children . 8 . from 7 , it would be against the interests of singapore if less people have children . 9 . from 8 , a policy resulting in less people having children is against the interests of singapore . 10 . from 6 and 9 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage is against the interests of singapore . 11 . the government of singapore should not support a policy against the interests of singapore . conclusion from 10 and 11 , the government should not support a policy of legalising same sex marriage . i believe this is a valid argument , i . e . that it is logically impossible to accept all 11 premises and reject the conclusion . how do you find this argument ?

second , i use the term protestants generally simply because you have been using anglicans and catholics . it is long and tiring to have to say the other christians who are not anglicans or catholics , so i have used protestants . if you prefer another label that is convenient , i have no problems using that . thank you for confirming and proving my point . you have deep seated psychological issue that causes you to casually stereotype vastly different groups . here is what you said earlier you seem to be saying that hang on , the protestants are way worse ! they have their wear white campaign , and pray that it will rain on pink dot . you would rather further generalize and stereotype with protestant a 10 letter word , than use the acronyms of the groups that both organize wear white movement and have conversion therapy , both of which contain only 4 characters . essentially you are now saying angelicans , methodists , presbyterians , all of the seven local denominations actively participate in the wear white campaign . and your reasoning is because it is long and tiring . it literally takes less effort to actually not stereotype and name the actual groups . if that s not a prime example of stererotyping , i don t know what is . your psychological issue of casual stereotyping is propagating misinformation and falsehoods , and you need to stop . if you can t , i suggest you seek help , because people like you stir up dissent amongst peaceful relationships . by the way , the notion that not all protestants participate in or even support the wear white campaign , or conversion therapy . can simply be reversed to point out that not all catholics are opposed to wear white or conversion therapy . clearly , you will see variance in the nature of belief in any faith , so any discussion will necessarily have to encompass some degree of generalities . i m sure you recognize a fundamental difference between a group that teaches love and accept lgbt people and a group that teaches homosexuality is a mental illness . you even said it yourself that one is worse . so why are you still sterotyping both groups as one , while naming only the groups that are relatively more supportive and passive by not actually actively organizing anti lgbt movements , while refusing to admit you re willfully being obtuse by choosing to disregard the groups that are organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? i ve already explained that i still regard the differences as fairly minor , in the grand scheme of things . therefore you are admitting that you are sterotyping , and your intention is therefore to stir shit because you know and admit one group is worse than the other but you still support calling the group that is relatively more supportive and passive out and ignoring the group that is actively campaigning against lgbt . i know you re going to deny it , you can keep telling yourself that , but i really don t know how you sleep at night knowing that because you re too afraid to shatter your fragile ego , you refuse to admit that you would rather call the group that teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people out as the largest anti lgbt group while you completely disregard the actual group that organizes anti lgbt campaigns . to me , you are willfully spreading lies and misinformation that all churches have the same stand regarding lgbt , an issue that my lgbt friends and family have shown to be something they care about as it matters to them what their friends and family actually believe . it also matters to them that for all the acceptance of them , the catholic church still does not consider them able to get married . indeed , many might prefer the outright homophobia than that apparent hypocrisy of the catholic church . oh look , another strawman . what does it matter to my lgbt family or friends if the church doesn t consider them eligible for marriage ? they can get married outside of the church . my friend or family member doesn t have to be a christian to be my friend or family . my friend or family member doesn t have to agree with my beliefs to be my friend or family . . what matters to my friends and family is that im not prejudiced against them , nor do i think they have a mental illness that should be cured . you keep talking about 377a as if it s the only issue here , no it s not . you need to stop weaseling around the main point that you are spreading falsehoods about the catholic and the majority of the local protestant groups , because the issue isn t just 377a . it s also about the core teachings of the church and how it affects the daily relationships between lgbt people and church goers . to say that one group teaches love and acceptance and another teaches mental illness is a minor difference , on top of naming only the groups that teaches love and acceptance as anti lgbt out of seven protestant denominations while disregarding the group the teaches mental illness an obvious act of shit stirring . i don t ? for goodness sake for someone that complains over and over about lies and misinformation , you could do well to actually read what you are complaining over . i have clearly explained that while the churches have different approaches it s literally in my first post that the catholic church holds a less critical view , i regard the difference as minor . this is obviously different from the same view . so teaching love and accept lgbt people . don t discriminate , don t judge is a minor difference from homosexuality is a mental illness that should be cured . got it . i understand your stance clearly now . you re a shit stirrer , whether you want to admit it or not . and sorry , catholics are by no means the most supportive of lgbt people . i don t know where this idea is based from , but lgbt find much more support amongst secular support groups than the catholic church . even among religious groups , buddhists are far more accepting of lgbt people . just among christians , it is the free community church not catholic that actually supports lgbt people . come on , are you really that stupid ? is it not obvious enough that i m making the point within the confines of christianity ? let me put it simply for you then since you insist on playing dumb . amongst the christian groups , despite being passively supportive to 377a which is anti lgbt to a minor degree compared to actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns , catholics that teach love and accept lgbt people is the most supportive group compared to other groups that teach homosexuality is a mental illness and groups that actively hold anti lgbt campaigns . . is that better for you ? if you re going to talk about free community church then i m going to ask , why are you shifting the goal post to now include a church that isn t even on the national council of churches ? i literally mention protestants in my first post , which says that both the catholic church and the protestants are the main anti lgbt group . so why not just say christians ? the fact you separate the two groups show that you are not ignorant of the fact they have vastly different teachings regarding lgbt . and since you are not ignorant of that fact , why do you still sterotype them into having the same teaching and stance ? the catholic church is , as a matter of fact , anti lgbt , and you can t run away from that simply because some protestant churches are worse . i never said that they weren t . let me help you establish some facts . 1 the catholic church supports 377a . 2 most protestant groups support 377a . from these two facts , i ll give it to you that they are anti lgbt with regards only to 377a . 3 the catholic church teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people . 4 a certain denomination of the protestants group organizes the wear white campaign , an anti lgbt campaign . 5 a certain denomination of the protestants believe that homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured via conversion therapy . now , you yourself have admitted that there is a difference between the beliefs and teachings of the above mentioned groups . i m leaving out angelicans here for simplicity . however , you are still adamant in saying the difference is only minor , when clearly these teachings significantly affect the day to day relationships between lgbt people and church goers . 6 the person you are defending says that catholics and angelicans are the largest anti lgbt group . 7 the person you are defending clearly knows that he is singling out two specific groups , the catholic church , and the angelican church , which is only one out of at least seven local protestant denominations , and even excluded the non denominational churches by not categorizing the entire group as christians instead . given that the person knows very well there is a distinction between the groups , he still chose to single out group 3 , catholics , and the angelican church , and completely disregard groups 4 and 5 . tell me , what does this behavior look like to you ?

i recall a few years ago when moh hpb had an online infographic about trans lgbt health but it was sadly taken down because of pressure from some vocal parts of society .,"its a really well written article , and i hope that our society becomes more inclusive over time . i recall a few years ago when moh hpb had an online infographic about trans lgbt health but it was sadly taken down because of pressure from some vocal parts of society . so sometimes , we can t expect ministries or govt to take the lead , because there has been more than one time when ministries are progressive but get whacked by society . i do have one gripe about this article , which is this to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology . science does have a role in addressing some of these questions , but at the end of the day , morality and ethics has to answer the most important parts . and it s bad to shove it all to science and technocrats , because science doesn t have these answers . for example , there is a question as to whether should minors be allowed to go through permanent procedures . science can t answer such a question . science can tell us that gender dysphoria is a mental health condition , but science won t tell you that the best way to address this is by allowing procedures for minors . society has to determine what should be the limits of consent . and while a culture war fuelled by ignorance is bad , a debate about ethics and morality should be viewed as a good thing . it s part and parcel of a robust democracy to determine what our values should be .

"the decision to repeal section 377a s377a of singapore s penal code , the divisive law that criminalises sex between men , has been met by disappointment from the alliance of pentecostal and charismatic churches of singapore apccs .","the decision to repeal section 377a s377a of singapore s penal code , the divisive law that criminalises sex between men , has been met by disappointment from the alliance of pentecostal and charismatic churches of singapore apccs . prime minister lee hsien loong made the announcement to repeal the colonial era law during the national day rally 2022 ndr 2022 on sunday 21 august . singapore plans to amend its constitution to enshrine the definition of marriage and prevent the issue from being challenged in the courts , lee added . in a media statement released after ndr 2022 , apccs chairman reverend yang tuck yong said , the repeal is an extremely regrettable decision which will have a profound impact on the culture that our children and future generations of singaporeans will live in . however , we also recognise that the government seeks to bring about a balance among many differing viewpoints on this matter . we strongly urge the government to entrench the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman in the singapore constitution . that would be the most prudent way forward . should the matter be put to a parliamentary vote , the party whip should be lifted as part of due democratic process in multi religious singapore , apccs said , so that members of parliament can represent the voice of all people , including the religious , and vote according to the feedback they have received . the roman catholic archdiocese of singapore also responded to the repeal of s377a , saying , we do not seek to criminalise the lgbtq lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , for they too are children of god and loved by him . in a statement on its website , the church added , however , we seek protection of the family and marriage according to natural law and our rights to teach and practise them unhindered . we must not allow reverse discrimination to take place against those who believe in marriage as defined between a man and a woman . taking comfort in the government s plan to enshrine the definition of marriage in the constitution , it added , otherwise , we will be taking a slippery road of no return , weakening the fabric of a strong society which is founded on the bedrock of holistic families and marriages . the humanist society , which seeks to represent non religious people in singapore , said it celebrates the announcement to repeal s377a . s377a , a vestige of british colonial rule , criminalised sex between consenting male adults . it dehumanised individuals , infringed upon the most personal of liberties , and imposed a religious code on a secular public , it said in a statement . we note that while some individuals or organisations may have disagreed with the repeal , we hope that they will eventually come around to see that building a fairer , more inclusive , secular society benefits everyone , regardless of race , language , religion , or sexual orientation . with this repeal , we can look forward to a more progressive singapore society , based on justice and equality . pink dot sg , a support group for the lgbt community , said that while the repeal is a hard won victory , it comes as far too late for many due to past victims of s377a who had faced threats such as raids and criminal charges . it also expressed disappointment on the proposed constitution amendment to enshrine the definition of heterosexual marriage , urging the government not to heed recent calls from religious conservatives for such a move . such a decision will undermine the secular character of our constitution , codify further discrimination into supreme law , and tie the hands of future parliaments . the announcement to repeal s377a comes after years of contentious debates and legal challenges from various parties who either argue for and against the law . in 2007 , parliament amended the penal code but left s377a unchanged . s377a , which refers to sexual acts between men but not women and specifies the punishment for violation , reads , any male person who , in public or private , commits , or abets the commission of , or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of , any act of gross indecency with another male person , shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years . the government had maintained that while s377a is written in law , it would not be actively enforced in order to reach a messy compromise between the conservative majority who want to preserve the sanctity of marriage and family , and top legal professionals , civil activists , the lgbt community and others who have been pushing for its repeal . https sg . news . yahoo . com ndr 2022 churches section 377a

the 3rd group of gender rights activists are special .,"to consider such things , one must consider the motivation of activists fighting for equal rights in general . generally , activists fighting such causes can be grouped as follows 1 . personal stakes , 2 . popularity , and 3 . ideology . this probably is non exhaustive but i can t think of others right now . if you look at groups 1 and 2 , you will realise they rarely have any intention to care beyond the scope . of course some people who fight because they are personally involved have good reasons , such as sexual victims fighting for a space to voice out against masculinity . others fight because they are disadvantaged in their pursuits , for example , maybe some overly ambitious careerwomen . then you also have the sjw who only care about such causes because it makes them feel popular and important . they are all fighting for their own stakes and own benefit . they rarely have any interest to care about anything beyond . in general , these are the people who have a not my business mentality and the driving reason why they are involved in the first place is because it is their business . but beyond that narrow scope , it is no longer their business . also , given that none of these activists usually realise their goals , they will always feel that their fight is incomplete and they rarely see a reason to divert energy away from their goals . so , why would group 1 and 2 of gender rights activists care about truly equal gender equality ? group 1 cares mostly because they are at the pointy end of the stick , and they are fighting to get out of that end . to some , they don t even care who the pointy end points at next , as long as they aren t the ones . this often give rise to the paradoxical situation where the fight for equality is merely a fight to change the oppressors from one group to another , which in this case , if they succeed , they will be the new oppressors . group 2 gender rights activists fights simply because it is cool , popular . they have no ideology , nor do they have any serious personal stakes beyond popularity , importance and ego . given that the narrative against male rights , and nonsense narratives of how males are dominant regardless of reality emphasis on regardless of reality , it is unpopular for them to back or at least acknowledge such things as male equality . the 3rd group of gender rights activists are special . as ideological driven people , they are very committed and intense . but , whether they care about similar moral issues depends on their ideology . like how some people believe in really ridiculous and warped ideologies , such as racial supremacy or male chauvinism , there can exists a warped female version the female chauvinist . the female version , like the male one , believes their own gender as superior , and thus see no issue whatsoever with inequality . there is no hope at all to think they would even care . another kind of the 3rd group are logical ideologues , who believe in general gender equality . for some , they might not yet see or realise how men is disadvantaged sometimes emphasis on sometimes . these are one of the most hopeful of the bunch , as they are likely to eventually see the actual situation and not some narrative . for others , they know and they do understand , but they can t fight or were denied any spotlight because of prevailing societal narrative demonising or downplaying the problem . the problem today with social media is the danger of forming the wrong kind of narratives . once the narrative is formed , opposition are disregarded regardless of logic , and often being demonised as the opposite of what they want to be . the problem is , the narrative has already been formed . the narrative does not care about facts , it only cares about what panders to the masses . the female inequality , with them being the weak and vulnerable gender , generally does very well pandering to the emotions of the masses . so , why do no one stand up for male equality , despite it being a problem ? the answer is simple , either they do not care , or they can t stand up without being heckled . i dare say that some sjw are heckling you right now and probably have excuses about how men are so dominant that a little oppression couldn t hurt and only make them more equal . emphasis on the quotation marks . edit grammar",13-09-2020 12:38,Reddit,rights,1

"but many activists have made clear their intent to go beyond repeal and push for , among other things , same sex marriage and controversial sexuality education .","section 377a of the penal code , which criminalises acts of gross indecency between males in public or private , is one of the most controversial topics in singapore today . some consider the law to be outdated and discriminatory against people who identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq , et cetera . others who favour retaining section 377a consider the law to be a critical symbol of singapore s mainstream values on marriage and family , as well as sexuality and gender . apart from law and policy , the debate also has implications on a wider question of social harmony how can people with vastly differing viewpoints coexist side by side in singapore society , without resulting in clashes or conflicts over deeply held values ? with these issues in mind , we consider what the best way forward is . since we started reading and writing about this matter , we have realised that children and youth are the most vulnerable in this great tussle of value systems . foreign news reports tell of young children being made to learn that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , that gender confusion an often conflicting and painful experience is not just normal , but should be celebrated and accompanied by irreversible treatment from a very young age . these practices may be harmful to children . for example , sweden has largely banned the use of puberty blockers to treat gender confused children , owing to harmful side effects , and the united states authorities have recently warned of side effects such as symptoms of brain swelling . children are also taught that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , and encouraged to be sexually experimental since all sexual behaviours are equal , despite the science showing that some behaviours are riskier than others . in singapore , we already have local examples of school going children encouraged to use gender pronouns in controversial ways and young teenagers identifying as pansexual and the alienating or bullying of those who disagree . marriage , family , children and societal values so what has repealing section 377a to do with this ? as the only law that retains a distinction between heterosexual and homosexual behaviours , its existence , on principle , restrains advancing lgbtq activism that contributes to a hyper sexualised environment and a disproportionate focus on sexual and gender identities . its non enforcement allows our fellow lgbtq citizens to engage in such sexual behaviours without government intervention . but many activists have made clear their intent to go beyond repeal and push for , among other things , same sex marriage and controversial sexuality education . however , to have fruitful and honest public debate on these other issues , it is crucial for those with contrary views to resist strong international pressure such as through diversity policies in global multinational corporations and the immense intimidation on social media . if section 377a is repealed , the ground will only become further divided and civil dialogue harder to achieve . activists have called the threat to family a myth , saying that the repeal will not cause a breakdown of marriage in terms of divorces . however , while existing individual marriages may not break down , marriage and family as social institutions with public importance will be affected . it is critical that social policy continues to prioritise the best interests of children , whenever possible . decades of social science show that the best conditions to raise a child are when the child grows up in a healthy family with both a biological father and mother , who are in a stable and lasting marriage . at the level of state wide policies , if the traditional family unit is weakened , society will be weakened as well , with implications for social policy , welfare spending and criminal justice . we know how important it is to give children good homes to thrive in , and to involve both fathers and mothers in their children s lives because each plays a unique and complementary role in the parenting of their children . thus , one of us founded dads for life to reduce the adverse impact of fatherlessness including physically or emotionally absent or abusive fathers on children . the other continued his work in designing and delivering highly customised marriage and family development programmes for families at various stages of their life cycles , including helping former convicts to reintegrate into their families and society , as well as being a chief juror for an annual exemplary fathers award , which has gone a long way to inspire fathers in the community . on the other hand , in a same sex household , a child loses a connection with either a father or a mother . given that half of a child s dna comes from the father , and the other half comes from the mother , to say that two fathers or two mothers make no difference to the child is to put adults desires before the needs and rights of the child . this is on top of the ethical difficulties surrounding the ways in which same sex couples obtain children such as surrogacy , which objectifies children , and women who are surrogates . if there is no proper consideration of all these possible negative effects of same sex marriages and family , we put children at risk by entering uncharted territory at the level of public policy . the existing status quo on section 377a is based on a careful balance and a political compromise adopted by parliament in 2007 following an extensive debate . this political package to use the words of our apex court already achieves a precious and well thought out balance . it ensures that the norms and values on marriage and family will remain mainstream , while giving space for lgbtq people to live freely and contribute to society . best way forward seeing how the repeal of section 377a can have a far wider and deeper impact on our policies relating to family and children than we realise , what is the best way forward ? who should we be most concerned about ? the repeal of section 377a does not just affect the definition of marriage , but also has repercussions on the well being of children . therefore , children should be the first priority . and we believe the majority will agree . since children develop best in a stable family with their married biological parents , we should try our very best to promote and protect such a family structure . we recognise that society is imperfect and families are imperfect , but that does not mean we should not strive towards the ideal in public policies , while offering support to others who already find themselves in imperfect conditions . we must do everything we can to protect our children , and we strongly recommend the following enshrine man woman marriage in our constitution , to show how we cherish the time tested value of the natural family unit as a nation , and to protect against any attempt to redefine it . having it enshrined in the constitution the highest law of the land will ensure that it is protected for the long term , it can be amended only by a two thirds majority of parliament , and man woman marriage has the highest priority in law and policy . enshrining man woman marriage in our constitution is insufficient to protect children from being indoctrinated with controversial and age inappropriate ideas and beliefs on sexuality . to better protect children , we must enact new legislation . this ensures that all other related policies , for example , guidelines on media codes and sex education in schools , can take reference from this new legislation the way it is being done now , with section 377a maintaining the distinction between homosexual and heterosexual relations . alternatively , the same effect can be achieved by keeping section 377a , given that the provision has already been vigorously debated in parliament , with the stance taken that it would not be proactively enforced . if section 377a is to be amended at all , a possible amendment might be to remove the words in private . if this is done , traditional marriage and legislation relating to children must be in place . it must also be made clear that the section is retained in the amended form as an important signal as to the norm of heterosexual relations . we would like to stress that this is not about discriminating against those who identify as lgbtq . we further denounce any threats of harm to those in the community . disagreeing with certain ideas is not discrimination . the debate over section 377a is about much more than the repeal of a provision that is not being proactively enforced . more importantly , it concerns the well being of our children and our nation . it would be very unwise for the government to repeal section 377a until and unless there are robust safeguards in place , especially for the sake of our children . singapore is at a unique juncture in time , at which it can chart its own course that avoids the polarisation over lgbtq issues that has divided many societies in the west , maintain the commitment to family values that have helped singapore to thrive , and allow space for different groups to contribute to society . the current precious and careful balance has served singapore well , and we should decide wisely as we consider the best way forward on section 377a . jason wong is a former senior civil servant , and the founder of the yellow ribbon project and the dads for life movement . mohd khair is a local and regional trainer and consultant who has helped many parents , youth and families through designing , developing and delivering highly interactive training programmes for more than two decades . both organised the recent protect singapore townhall event to discuss the impact of repealing section 377a of the penal code . the views expressed here are in their personal capacity .

"calling this issue as a a matter of political correctness , fails to account for the substantive effect of 377a ."," true we are not single issue voters , but you want to appeal as much as possible to broader audiences . i think this goes back to my earlier point about the reserved presidency , casinos , and even the fake news bill as it was passed . these matters faced wide spread and broad lack of popularity , far more than the worst case scenario of every single christian and catholic being a single issue voter who would vote out the government for voting in 377a . the fact that despite this , we still have casinos , the current president , and the fake news bill , suggests to me that the pap well knows that singaporeans are not single issue voters . consequently the entire political necessity argument stands on shaky legs . history has shown that singaporeans are willing to stomach deeply unpopular issues so long as the government overall is seen to be doing good . unless something drastically changes , the stance for political correctness seems to be not addressing the elephant in the room . which is why in my first post above i mentioned that if we do become a more secular nation , repealing 377a would be the main talking point to appear more progressive . i find the use of political correctness here rather curious , because if you accept that the existence of 377a is not a morally neutral position , and that gay men lack the same ability to legally have anal intercourse , then it follows that 377a is an issue that goes well beyond the window dress of political correctness . it has substantive impact of gay men in singapore a point directly acknowledged by the court of appeal . calling this issue as a a matter of political correctness , fails to account for the substantive effect of 377a . haha i like to think that the imagine part of the sentence whoever compasses , imagines , invents , devises , or intends the death is just legal trying to cover all bases , however silly it may seem in foresight . the word imagine is only used in this manner in relation to the president , and not other crime . it s there intentionally , and not simply legally trying to cover all bases . it literally creates a thought crime . my point in referring to s121a is to draw a direct contrast to crimes that truly are unenforceable . 377a is currently enforced simply because the present government and ag says so . these positions can change in the future , and unlike the thought crime of s121a , there is no technical or theoretical problems with enforcing 377a . it has been enforced in the past , and if the government changes its mind , it can be enforced in the future . the very question i ask myself when they banned a certain band from performing in singapore . the thing about political landscapes is that organised entities always have more negotiating power . they can collectively drop support for a single politician , because they stand together . again , i find this reasoning suspect . in order for this to be a substantive worry , these are the things that would have to happen i christians and catholics vote as a united bloc ii christians and catholics are all single issue voters on and that issue is the repeal of 377a iii christians and catholics are equally distributed across all grcs in the country for maximum effect and iv christians and catholics are willing to vote for the other party , solely based on this single issue . my view is that the more likely scenario is that our government is not as secular as it professes , and that within the government , there is an over representation of christians who are unable to separate their personal religious view on lgbt issues , and the question of whether as a secular nation such matters should be in the law . this explanation is far more likely than the phantom fear of the existence of a large single issue christian voting bloc .

"i hold no love for his pov , what surprised me is that he said he has same sex attraction and shared a bit about his time while he was active in the gay community .","unfortunately i went to watch the whole thing because i wanted to hear them out before commenting . i ll just summarise my observations and give some thoughts . the reporter and the dialogue centre director generally said thing that were more to the side of empathy towards the lgbtq a . k . a queers , i want to use this word instead because it s easier and can represent true community . the reporter didn t say much , and the director mostly shared stories about folks from the queer community . he also shared about how there needs to be civil dialogue , and this point about having dialogue is something that generally everyone in the panel agreed with . he didn t introduce this point btw . most of the sharing came from the pink dot pd rep . he shared experiences about queer folks , highlighted about how everyone should be able to express themselves , have civil discussions and etc . i m feel that he did alright pertaining to the issues discussed , in general . the 3 16 rep was mostly concerned about cancel culture , spoke about how his church helped to equip parents to handle when their children come out , and shared experiences about discrimination from one person who was called a homophobe and was bullied and he claims that person is not actually a homophobe . i hold no love for his pov , what surprised me is that he said he has same sex attraction and shared a bit about his time while he was active in the gay community . the first topic was about today s poll about 377a repeal and same sex marriage is it wrong , and is it important to define it as man and woman . pd rep says it s an opportunity to talk to these people and educate them , while 3 16 says that these respondents likely did their homework and came to the conclusion that marriage s definition as man and woman should stay , citing the if you allow gay marriage , then what s next ? ? ? type of fear mongering . there s a lot that could have been discussed and i think this debate could have taken up the entire hour , but in general i don t like the 3 16 s assumption that all respondents have researched opinions . i would hypothesise that they actually just answered in a way that supports the government s reasoning government says we are repealing 377a but keeping marriage s definition as m f . therefore 377a is bad . uphold definition of marriage as m f is good . we live in a effectively one party state , and i would say that the trickle down of opinions on social matters from the government could be the reason for this . if you disagree with my hypothesis , that s valid . unfortunately the today survey didn t ask why people responded this way . it just noted that religious people were more likely to support 377a s stay , and support the definition of marriage as m f . btw the 3 16 guy said that saying the framing of these statistics shouldn t be confined to religion . this is something that is contradicted by the reporter s article . the article highlights that religious people are the ones who are more opposed to 377a and prefer m f marriage definition . but the reporter mostly just nods as if she doesn t want to say that she highlighted that religious people were more opposed in her article . like , why else would the reporter highlight that religious people were more opposed if it religion isn t a main factor ? anyways then they discussed about the safety of queer folks in sg . generally the director and pd rep said that there s a lot of emotional and psychological damage , and not so much of physical although there is some in the form of getting kicked out of the house for example . 3 16 guy s response was that there are were cases of people having different ideas about queerness who were discriminated . he said i had one guy who was accused of being homophobic despite not being homophobic , and he was bullied . he also had one other example relating to work but it s similar in nature to his point . i mostly agree with the director and pd rep . 3 16 rep was basically pulling the old i m actually the victim card . christians and muslim make up like more than 30 of the population 2020 singstat , while queer people only make up like 12 2022 ipsos as i ve mentioned it s usually religious people who are highlighted as the opposition to queer rights , so i feel that he is wrong to try and play the victim here . the predominant culture has been to suppress queers . this guy even talked about the police raids on gay scenes many years ago . this 12 is the weaker community , whilst the 30 have the numbers and a long standing culture of heteronormativity in the country . is bullying anti queer people wrong ? arguably yes , but it s likely much less of an issue than queer bullying . there was a lengthy session about cancel culture , basically everyone say cancelling is wrong and we should talk things out . i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against . like dude , you learnt to suppress your true sexual self . i would feel bad for you if you weren t part of a church that works to convert people into abstinence from their same sex attractions . also , the issue is not about attraction . who you are attracted to could largely be kept secret . it is hard to discriminate by who youre attracted to . it is , however , easy to discriminate against people who act on those attractions because they are engaging in a physical act that can be caught seen by other people . don t equivocate attraction with the issue being discussed , which is about expressing thoughts and ideas . it s not the same topic and isn t relevant . another thought is that i wish that the pd rep talked about how cancel culture is something that is not just done by the left , it s also done by the right . if i come out to my conservative christian extended family , they aren t going to just agree to disagree they ll call me a sinner and likely ask me to go for conversion therapy or repent . that is cancel culture too . i expressed my thoughts and got shamed , and was silenced and asked to reform . tbc edit some spelling and grammar fixes . lack of brainpower to fix everything",16-11-2022 23:12,Reddit,same sex,1

people who make efforts to prevent homosexual relations whatever that means ?,"the law does govern private relations when it comes to sex . 377a would be unenforceable pragmatically unless you get caught doing it in public , which would have been a crime regardless of orientation . how do you prevent something that happens between people in private ? people who make efforts to prevent homosexual relations whatever that means ? doing so without the law only show that the law itself is pointless no one uses it or can realistically use it . what is left is the threat of someone using it , or even reforms to strengthen it , as well as the symbolism and meaning of the provision to denigrate lgbt folk as second class citizens . as long as the law exists , lgbt folk will not be able to be fully accepted as part of society . i find that there are already plenty of laws that run against homosexuals , such as the fact that they cannot marry . they already face discrimination as is why add to it ? this is why i don t agree that the law is a good middle stance just because there isn t outright prosecution or arrest for homosexuals , etc doesn t mean the law is somehow a compromise between the two parties . as long as the law remains , society will unlikely be able to progress to become a more empathetic , encompassing one . but the reason the repeal debate has revived is because the government is planning to reform the penal code this month . this is the best chance for any reform of 377a outside of political goodwill direct parliamentary intervention . this is all my opinion , in any case , and i have nothing against you personally , just voicing my thoughts on a public forum .

"we just need to spell it out formally rather than casting it as common sense , because only then can we safely remove the christian doctrine and hence , laws against homosexuality completely from the law without exposing it to arguments that seek to repeal other laws currently upheld by that doctrine ."," . . . legalized homosexuality was the doorway to legalized bestiality and pedophilia we begin by legalizing homosexuality . in doing so we reject the basis on which the law was created likely due to christian doctrine , traces back to our british colonial history . christian doctrine ceases to be a legitimate basis in the upholding of certain other laws actually on most counts , it probably already has . in the absence of other backing arguments , these laws are in fact open to debate . new reasoning is required if we are to uphold these other laws . they could be from concepts of morality from other religions or based in science , but the point is that new consensus has to be reached , and with it comes a discussion not unlike the one we re having right now . what really is the basis on which we uphold our laws ? x200b hypothetically this new consensus could be formed upon a moral framework not unlike the one you suggested , which seeks to uphold human rights as long as they don t infringe on others . a minority group of people who practice bestiality can then make the argument that they don t infringe on anyone s freedom . following which , our initial rejection of the christian doctrine and legalizing of homosexuality has led to the legalizing of bestiality . pedophilia probably doesn t work out under this framework , but a different consensus albeit a more absurd one could lead to its legalization as well . x200b i don t mean to imply that homosexuals and people who practice bestiality are the same class of people , and this hypothetical scenario is really just that hypothetical but where legalization is concerned , op s argument that legalizing homosexuality can eventually lead to legalized bestiality , is not entirely without merit . x200b that said , the reason why most people wouldn t think this hypothetical scenario is likely is probably because there is already a general consensus that exists which separates the homosexuals from these other classes of people . we just need to spell it out formally rather than casting it as common sense , because only then can we safely remove the christian doctrine and hence , laws against homosexuality completely from the law without exposing it to arguments that seek to repeal other laws currently upheld by that doctrine . this is the framework i seek .

lai s mother said that on may 4 , at about 7am , hsia had gone to lai s home and allegedly told the victim he would teach him how to handle real estate matters . he had also supposedly asked lai to bring along identification documents . hsia then took lai back to his home before bringing the victim to the marriage registration centre . investigations further revealed that as the registration for marriage requires the consent of two external parties , hsia took lai to search for two people . both of the people that hsia subsequently found were reported to be young men in their 20s , at a nearby supermarket and just outside the centre . hsia reportedly obtained their signatures by asking both men if they supported same sex marriage and taking out the form for them to sign . hsia and lai then returned to hsia s residence at about 9am . lai was subsequently found dead outside the apartment building at 11am . taiwanese media initially reported that lai had fallen from the 10th floor to his death . family hired forensic doctor victim unlikely to have fallen to his death following the incident , lai s body was subjected to an autopsy by the taichung district prosecutor s office before being returned to the family . the family then commissioned another forensic doctor , kao ta cheng , to examine lai s body and the location of where his body was found . kao was subsequently quoted as saying that it was unlikely for lai to have died by falling from the 10th storey . he noted that the injuries lai had sustained were too light , with only a fractured right elbow and no haemorrhages in his head and abdominal cavities . kao suggested that lai was likely to have been poisoned instead and might have vomited shortly before his death , as indicated by the patch of dead grass where his body was found . responding to media queries , the district prosecutor s office for taichung added that its autopsy report on lai s death was still pending but it respected the relevant actions and remarks of the family and related personnel outside the legal proceedings . the office also reiterated that evidence of the crime must still undergo rigorous legal procedures and called for relevant parties not to infer the circumstances of the crime from conjecture and to let the judiciary do its job . suspect out on bail at s 13 , 100 in the meantime , hsia is reportedly out on bail at ntd300 , 000 s 13 , 100 . hsia and his father were reportedly subjected to a five hour long interrogation on may 22 by taichung s authorities . they did not respond to media questions when they left afterwards . in response to taiwanese media queries about the incident , hsia s father said he did not know anything . the victim s family has called for the prosecution to apply for hsia to be taken into custody to prevent him from fleeing . meanwhile , one of taichung s city councilors the equivalent of a member of parliament at the city level in taiwan , huang jian hao , has called for hsia to prove he had no motive in murdering lan by voluntarily renouncing his inheritance rights to lai s property . top screenshots via cts news youtube",21-05-2023,Hardware Zone,rights,0
"again , things like marriage are not rights protected under the constitution .","i can understand your point but it also strays far away from the argument of 377a . you state that there is a tangible negative effect . this doesn t make sense because even if you repeal it , those that are against the lgbt community are not suddenly going to be more accepting of it as even from op s perspective , it is clear that those that are against lgbt lifestyle aren t doing so because the government tells them to but because of their own backgrounds and understandings . when you mention civil liberties , we can assume things like marriage and not being prosecuted but as many have already said , it is not a law that is enforced and there is no evidence that suggests that once 377a is repealed , new laws will be added to give similar rights to lgbt folk that heterosexual people have which is why people say 377a is symbolic in the first place . but ignoring that , what is your definition of civil liberties ? what exactly are they being denied under the constitution ? again , things like marriage are not rights protected under the constitution . if you mention things like protection from hate speech then you should also understand that by definition they are technically still given that liberty . you can read what rights are protected and what exceptions there are here https sso . agc . gov . sg act cons1963 ? provids pr9 , pr10 , pr11 , pr12 , pr13 , pr14 , pr15 . the government has no responsibility to protect the lgbt community from religious individuals as they have every right to speak out as it is part of their doctrine not to accept homosexual acts just as how pro lgbt individuals are free to criticise their opinions . the idea that we should protect all minorities while good natured is impossible . we see this in eu countries that either have strong opposition towards letting in refugees , have opposition groups against pro refugee policies or have policies to better help transition of refugees due to the difference in cultures . similarly , the lgbt lifestyle runs against the lifestyle of the majority and thus , it is fair to have opposition against it . now , you might say that there is nothing wrong with the lgbt lifestyle but that isn t the point . tl dr under the constitution , they have the same rights and as mentioned before , 377a isn t enforced .

"following the court of appeal s ruling in february on section 377a , home affairs and law minister k .","what did the attorney general say in response to these calls ? following the comments by mr woon and mr rajah , attorney general lucien wong said in 2018 that the public prosecutor retains independence in deciding whether to pursue a case under section 377a . the police , when conducting investigations into an offence under the law , will decide whether or not there is sufficient basis to refer the case to the public prosecutor . the public prosecutor will then determine whether to charge an offender under the law , and in doing so exercises his independent discretion solely on the basis of his assessment of the facts , the law and the public interest . while the pp public prosecutor is entitled to consider public policies in exercising his discretion , these do not fetter the exercise of prosecutorial discretion , he had said . the public prosecutor s exercise of prosecutorial discretion has always been , and remains , unfettered . in the case of section 377a , where the conduct in question was between two consenting adults in a private place , the public prosecutor had , absent other factors , taken the position that prosecution would not be in the public interest . this remains the position today . how did the apex court rule on the most recent challenge ? in february , the court of appeal , led by the chief justice , held that section 377a is completely unenforceable in its entirety , meaning that while the law will stay on the books , it cannot be used to prosecute men for having sex with other men . legal scholars and the gay community lauded the decision for giving gay men real protection from prosecution under the law . the apex court said that the attorney general s comments in 2018 , when he said the public prosecutor would not prosecute two consenting men for having sex in private , had given legal significance to the political compromise struck in 2007 when pm lee said the law would not be proactively enforced . mr wong s representations had also given people a legitimate expectation of not being prosecuted under section 377a , based on the administrative law doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations , the court said . as such , section 377a would remain unenforceable unless and until the attorney general of the day revokes the 2018 representations . given this , the three men who challenged the law dr tan , mr ong and mr choong do not currently face any real and credible threat of prosecution . they thus do not have the legal standing to mount constitutional challenges against the law , the court said , dismissing their bid . the ruling could also mean that other gay men will not have the standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 377a , unless and until the attorney general s stance changes . how did the government respond to the latest court ruling ? following the court of appeal s ruling in february on section 377a , home affairs and law minister k . shanmugam said the government is carefully considering the best way forward on the law . he also reiterated the government s stance on the law , noting pm lee had said in 2007 that singaporeans want a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society . but mr shanmugam , who made the remarks in parliament when responding to questions from mps on the ruling , had also said that public policies need to evolve to keep abreast of changes in views in society , and legislation will also have to evolve to support updated policies . he said that if the government decides to move on the law , it will do so in a way that continues to balance these different viewpoints , and avoids causing a sudden , destabilising change in social norms and public expectations . shortly after , the government started its review of the law , consulting widely , including religious and lgbt groups . https www . straitstimes . com singap . . . gn stfb utm medium social utm source facebook",21-08-2022,Hardware Zone,377a,0

non trans athletes have a hard enough time getting their parent s support .,"i m a trans man , and transitioned back in 2011 . i m in touch with many other trans people in singapore . we re already here in society . we have families , we re a part of schools and workplaces , churches and mosques and temples . we use public toilets . we have mutual friends with jason wong . so the thing is while many people fear what will happen when trans people become part of society , trans people are already part of society . this also means some reframing is needed , because trans people are not a distinct group of strangers but people you may already know and interact with regularly without knowing . some may be your family who haven t come out yet , some may be friends or colleagues you don t know are trans , or the barista who makes your coffee , or the grab driver who cannot find your place , or the insurance agent who keeps calling you , or the old aunties chatting in the void deck . a common mistake seems to be assuming that accepting trans people means becoming like the most vocally aggressive of americans . but the reasons we re not like that have little to do with lgbtq rights and everything to do with singaporeans being an especially obedient population that s terrified of the government , for better or worse . ironically , it s the constant anti lgbtq content that is what is causing more of the community to step up into activism . when lgbtq people are being kicked out of homes , abused , insulted by teachers , sent for conversion therapy , denied the jobs we need to survive , banned from the healthcare we need to live , barred from starting families with the people we love , it makes it difficult to just stay quiet and instead call for changes that will ensure our safety , dignity and equality . do we accept feelings over science regarding trans people in sports ? science and social research . but this is also very much a western issue . it s like their debate over whether trans people should be allowed in the military over here , most trans women are trying to get out of the military rather than into it . the same applies to sports , because singapore is not a country that values sports the way they do in the west parents are much more concerned about exams . non trans athletes have a hard enough time getting their parent s support . trans girls in particular are also much less likely to enjoy sports because it s framed as such a masculine endeavour . already in the west , there are so few trans athletes that the small handful end up all over the news . our population is only a tiny fraction of theirs . it would be unlikely enough to even have one . it s also why it makes no sense to look to the west to anticipate problems , because any challenges if any that arise from integrating trans people into singapore society are going to be uniquely singaporean . when is the right time for hrt ? should we encourage hrt ? it s a medical treatment , so it s like asking if we should encourage people to take panadol if they have a fever . some trans people have body dysphoria that can only be resolved with hrt , and thus should be allowed to access it . other trans people are comfortable with their bodies but feel pressured into hrt to be taken seriously as their gender , and while in an ideal world they wouldn t feel that pressure , we don t live in that world yet . regardless , hrt has also been available in singapore for decades , and trans people have been on it for just as long . these are not new questions or issues , and more people simply being aware of them will not in itself change society .

2nd part some may argue that the very existence of 377a legalizes discrimination and constitutes of institutional discrimination towards lgbt in singapore .,"2nd part some may argue that the very existence of 377a legalizes discrimination and constitutes of institutional discrimination towards lgbt in singapore . note , 377a applies only to gays and not lesbians , and definitely not transgenders . so your point is , there is institutional discrimination to only gays , but not lesbians transgenders ? section 292 criminalizes the procession of pornographic materials , but as it is also rarely enforced , does it constitute of institutional discrimination of people who watch and download porn ? will i be fired from work , kicked out of house because the government legalized institutional discrimination towards people who love porn ? no ? same for 377a . so you don t care cause it technically doesn t affect you since i assume you are a post op transgender ? ok but other people do care that gay man can be charged for having sex with consent . liberals and activists love to claim gay discrimination in singapore . in an interview with buro 247 , writer and activist yi sheng ng claims , as a community that faces discrimination , where if our identities are known we face the risk of being bullied at school , abused in our families , and fired from work , we can t just sit back and wait for society to become nice . really ? the community faces discrimination ? doxxed ? bullied in school ? abused at homes and fired from work ? which third world part of singapore do you live in ? let me know , i ll investigate personally . eh there are so many cases and anecdotes of lgbtqs being bullied in school , kick out from their house , shun from the community , especially a religious one . there is even a shelter for homeless transgender who are kicked out and hotlines and counseling services for lgbtqs . yes , discrimination towards the lgbt exists , it exists in individualized employers , traditional families and social and religious groups . however there is barely any institutional homophobia nor discrimination towards gays in singapore . come on gays , let s not just make it all about you . yes , racial , age and religious discrimination exists , and the ministry of manpower and the tripartite alliance for fair and progressive employment practices tafep have their relevant legislation and guidelines on handling discrimination , and to ensure hiring practices that are fair and based on meritocracy and non discriminatory practices . facing discrimination at your workplace ?

where is the action to translate into a concrete action for the collective wishes of the lgbt community , ie , repell 377a and to legalize gay marriage ? what next for the lgbt individuals in singapore ? nothing changes . the government allocated hong lim park as a speaker s corner for singaporeans to gather and to host events the only designated spot in singapore . as the government knows , singaporeans need an outlet to vent off steam , just as much the pubescent 13 year old teen sneaks his elder brother s porn stash into his room to vent every once in a while . and that s exactly what pink dot is doing an annual venting of steam . 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 worth of community donations every year ? yup , they go to av sound systems , equipment rental , apparels and decorations , so that you can make it a grand party to get together and rah rah . so at the end of it , where do the funds go ? how about any towards at risk groups for the lgbt community ? and when the last confetti is tossed and the last pink champagne popped , what happens next for the lgbt community ? nothing . it s like an sg50 party year after year after year . fair enough if you don t feel that it helps , although some may argue that the fact that it has become popular means that the government has taken note of it and have to be more wary when reviewing such laws . it may take some time , but it is entirely possible they might with enough public pressure . it also shows lgbtqs that hey people in singapore do care about you and do want to ensure that you have equal rights as other singaporeans . also , it fun to piss off the waapd crazies . want to help the plight of the lgbt community in singapore ? put your money to real causes to help the marginalized lgbt individuals . there are much more worthy causes in singapore , see project t , a shelter for homeless transgenders in singapore oogachaga , a counseling and personal development agency for lgbt individuals . pink dot ? nope . oh wait , didn t you say that discrimination against lgbtq wasn t that serious , so why have such organizations ? oh btw , i believe oogacha sp is a sponsor and pink dot does highlight what they do to the public . finally , there s nothing proud to be gay just like there s nothing proud about being straight . if you are gay , you are just as normal as the next straight guy , why do you need a event to celebrate being gay ? how about let s make july hetrosexual pride month ? no ? i personally do not need pink dot nor a gay pride parade because i live with pride everyday of my life and surround myself with friends and loved ones . i am proud of my career achievements , my life experiences , and not because of my identity . i don t need an annual virtue signalling parade to make me feel good about who i am . the fact is , i am a singaporean first , and a transgender second . i would rather be celebrated for the former than for being different as the latter . pink dot this year ? nope , i wasn t even sipping a pink margarita , not even close . ok good for you . in any case , it does seem you acknowledge that discrimination exist in singapore but you feel that pink dot doesn t do enough , you want real action . it also feels to me that you are either sick and tired of gay men and ladies being the centre of attention and how people are not focusing on transgender people like you . that pink dot is only for the gays who are better off than transgender . you will only support something that directly and only benefits you . i don t know , sounds quite selfish and self centered to me because pink dot and the movement around yes does help gays , lesbians , queers and transgender people or just people who have issues about their sexuality .

the fact is op asked the question why does a man need to look at another man when he has the same body parts and the second commenter replied homosexual offences has been around since forever .," have you never heard of funding bias ? in my opinion john jay university is neutral , but if it were to be biased it is more likely to be biased towards the catholic church thanks to funding bias . i am not able to prove that people in the john jay university survey are not anti christians , but another similar survey done by actual catholics also published a 4 number https www . nytimes . com 2004 02 27 us two studies cite child sex abuse by 4 of priests . html so i am not anti christian for using 4 . i ve heard of funding bias but you re going to have to provide evidence that the people who conducted the survey and published the reports were biased . until you do , there is no way to prove that the numbers weren t exaggerated . now you are introducing the straw man of so i am not anti christian for using 4 . , the reason was that you associated 4 with the worldwide premise i set up , key points being the misrepresentation of in the us as being worldwide . the fact that you re introducing a new article not previously discussed or referenced to talk about something that arose from different articles shows just how desperate you are in your attempts to weasel . a quote from the new article you linked even proves my point that the church scandals have nothing to do with homosexuality but the john jay researchers differed , saying in an interview that they have no data on sexual orientation of the perpetrators and that the more likely explanation is that sexual abuse is a crime of opportunity and priests had more unfettered access to teenage boys than to teenage girls . you claim that i am misleading because i did not include the united states . fair point , and i will go edit my comment to include it now . but do you not think that you are not more misleading for using the number 4392 to claim that the percentage of sexual assaults is 1 , when the original survey that published the 4392 number stated that the percentage is 4 ? no i do not . i have nothing to edit and nothing to hide . i took the higher of the two definite numbers i could find , and considered that number as part of the worldwide statistic . the us is within the world , right ? there are no other definite numbers to use , no official studies or reports i can point to to base any other number upon . i even said at least 4392 to be as honest as possible . i don t give a damn what reason pope francis asked him to stay for . that is not important . proves my point , you ignore the reason in order to mislead the reader . i think it is better for him to deal with the situation that happened under his watch than to get away from it scott free . or are you saying he shouldn t be held accountable for the incidents that happened under his watch ? regarding the oakland diocese , the reason why i said the covering up is still occurring is because the oakland diocese priests have still yet to be reprimanded in any way by the diocese . if they were serious about being sorry for covering up sexual abuse cases , then they should have released a public post saying we are aware of the cases against the two oakland diocese priests . we have reprimanded them , and from now onwards , they will not be allowed to continue staying mass . wow , that s a huge leap of logic . how does yet to reprimand equate to covering up ? could you please explain this in detail ? failure to address the issue adequately is a far cry from attempting to cover up anything . furthermore , are you seriously suggesting that the church should have reprimanded the priest due to an uninvestigated allegation ? i ve already addressed why they were still allowed to stay for mass , so i m not sure why you re asking a question i ve already answered . since you missed it , here s what i said as we have seen from a previous article https en . m . wikipedia . org wiki priest shortage in the catholic church text shortage 20by 20area , worldwide , to 201 . 229 20billion 20in 202012 . i ve linked , there is a shortage of catholic priests worldwide , a problem that would only be made worse if any and every allegation caused the removal of a priest . from the john jay report in the us , only 5 . 7 of the accused were found guilty . in addition to the fact that people like you , and the person you are defending , who continually attack the catholic church op s post and question has nothing to do with the church , it isn t surprising that many false allegations exists . also lol at the why would a man need to look at another man ? thing . did you know why i put that fake comment into my post ? because i wanted to see if you even read the original post to begin with . lol are you seriously going to play the i didn t make a mistake , i was just testing you card ? please , this isn t a primary school discussion , put your childish and honestly pathetic attempt to redeem yourself away . you didn t even put that fake comment into your post . it was a question asked by the initial poster , which was mentioned in my post that you replied to . you didn t make the statement , you merely responded to it on two seperate posts , filthy liar . also , are you seriously claiming credit for being dishonest after the whole sjw and innocent act you put up about how you have nothing against the church ? you just fell for my trap and proved that you didn t even know what the original comment was talking about , you just saw catholic church in the second commenters post and began attacking . thank you for admitting that you are here not to engage in an honest discussion , but rather employ traps meant to mislead . let the record show this is just how pathetic and cunning anti christians weasels are , and the type of cunning tactics they will employ in order to tarnish the reputation of the church . you re starting to show your true colors now and you re proving my point perfectly . to address your part ii comments , you re very right that back then is subjective ! so , to the second commenter , back then happened to be 30 years ago , so he mentioned a case that happened 30 years ago , possibly because he couldn t think of any other cases that happened 30 years ago . nothing wrong with that right ? exactly , so since it is subjective why did you paint a picture that it was an objective fact that he was referring to events 20 30 years back ? unless you have definite objective proof that was the time period he was referring to , the entire point you made in regards to back then is completely invalid . congratulations , you just played yourself . also regarding your point about pedophiles who abuse children on the same gender of them not necessarily being homosexual , yes you are very right . but in this case the offender isn t necessarily also a homosexual , is he ? when i used the word homosexual , i meant sexual behaviour between members of the same gender , which is one of the definitions listed by wikipedia . in both cases priests and this article , there was indeed a homosexual act being performed . so again , therein lies the similarity in both cases , homosexual acts were performed . one massive strawman and red herring here . it is irrelevant if the offender was homosexual or not . the fact is op asked the question why does a man need to look at another man when he has the same body parts and the second commenter replied homosexual offences has been around since forever . whether or not the offender was indeed homosexual or not has no bearing whatsoever on the question , or the answer . let the record show that you ve chosen to double down on defending an anti lgbt lie , and perpetuate the falsehood that homosexuality is associated with pedophilia . you re disgusting . pretending to speak up for victims of abuse while simultaneously associating homosexuality with pedophilia . so i think your points about not referring to priests as homosexuals noun are irrelevant , since we re talking about the use of the word homosexual as a adjective to describe a certain type of behaviour . you can weasel around the definition all you want , but let s look at the facts . from the article the holy see stated that the majority of catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under 18 year olds should not be viewed as pedophiles , but as homosexuals . anyone with half a brain can see that the word homosexuals here is a noun . more importantly , let s look at exactly what we are discussing , which is this statement homosexual sex offenders have been around forever , just look at the catholic church . the world homosexual in this case is obviously used as to describe the orientation of the sex offender . if the statement was homosexual sex offences have been happening . . that would then be an adjective describing the nature of the offences , so cut the bullshit about it being an adjective and get your facts right . your weaseling is seriously pathetic . you have chosen to double down on defending an anti lgbt lie and perpetuate the idea that pedophiles are associated with homosexuals . a truly disgusting and downright abhorrent thing to do . it s 2021 and yet people like you still exist . what a two faced piece of shit , saying what about listening to victims of abuse while simultaneously associating the maginalized lgbt group with pedophilia . i believe he is perfectly justified in doing so as he was merely bringing up a valid example to show that non consensual homosexual acts have been around since a long time ago . to sum up , my points remain the same . the catholic church has a pedophile problem , not a homosexual one . and the response there s always been homosexual sex offenders has nothing to do with the question why would a man need to look at another man when he has the same body parts . however , at this point i d like to add another point you are a disgusting person for associating pedophilia with homosexuality .

i m unsure . this study https www . medrxiv . org content 10 . 1101 2020 . 12 . 01 . 20241653v1 . full . pdf had 1 44 and references two other studies that had 2 57 and 5 137 who started pb but did not go on to csh . afaik all who started on csh continued . wouldn t you agree that current standards set by doctors really don t mean anything because this field and issue is so unprecedented . no , even without familiarity with trans topics , having a theoretical basis wrt developmental psychology , endocrinology etc . is important background knowledge . also , christine jorgensen had the first successful reassignment surgery in 1952 , wpath has worked with trans people since the 1980s , pbs were used for precocious puberty since the 80s , and the dutch protocol since 2000s , with the first cohort in their 20 30s . i know that won t be enough for some but i think that s enough data to make some reasonable guidelines . for every pediatrician who believes in puberty blockers at a young age , i can find an equal number who believe that it is only right to wait till a much older age of say , 18 . okay , the american academy of pediatrics wrote this guide https pediatrics . aappublications . org content 142 4 e20182162 with a membership of 67 000 . can you find me , say , 6700 doctors who disagree with it ?

he made the call in a paper titled equal justice under the constitution and section 377a of the penal code which was published online by the singapore academy of law journal on monday oct 14 .," former chief justice chan sek keong calls for review of section 377a , says law is outdated singapore former chief justice chan sek keong has called for the constitutional validity of section 377a , which criminalises sexual acts between men , to be reviewed . he made the call in a paper titled equal justice under the constitution and section 377a of the penal code which was published online by the singapore academy of law journal on monday oct 14 . advertisement advertisement in his paper , mr chan notes that section 377a criminalises acts of gross indecency between males , whether homosexual or bisexual , but not similar acts between males and females , or between females . he asked whether such unequal treatment violated the fundamental rights of all to equality before the law and equal protection under the law , as provided for under article 12 1 of the constitution . laws differentiating based on sex or gender must have a rational basis , he said , giving the example of parliament hypothetically passing a law against women smoking cigars . if parliament bans women , but not men , from smoking cigars , equality of all persons under article 12 1 requires the state to justify the reasonableness of the ban , said mr chan . advertisement advertisement this could be done on health grounds , if medical research showed women were more prone to lung cancer than men , for example . however , if this were based on parliament finding women smoking cigars undignified or unseemly , the courts would have to consider whether such a reason was legitimate , he argued . citing the case of lim meng suang who launched a legal bid against the constitutionality of section 377a in 2013 mr chan noted the judge at the time had upheld the law on the grounds that its purpose was to criminalise male homosexual conduct , as such behaviour was not acceptable or desirable here . however , the former chief justice noted that section 377a was in fact enacted in 1938 to strengthen laws against male prostitution , which was rife according to crime reports at the time and posed serious problems to law and order , public morality and wholesome government . section 377a was enacted for this purpose , and not because male homosexuality per se was unacceptable in singapore society , he said . the law , he argued , was a product of specific social conditions that have long ceased to exist here . mr chan described section 377a as an outlier in singapore s criminal law regime , and the only genuine gender specific offence in our criminal laws . government sees no legitimate state purpose in enforcement while section 377 under which carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animals was an offence was repealed in 2007 under amendments to the penal code , section 377a was retained . the decision not to repeal was based on the misapprehension that the section covered penetrative sex , a hallmark of male homosexuality , he said . parliament reaffirmed the wrong purpose , he added . furthermore , the decision not to repeal section 377a did not affirm its purpose , said mr chan . he noted mps at the time were not asked to vote on it as the government had already decided well before the parliamentary sitting that it would not repeal section 377a , but at the same time not enforce it . the decision not to enforce section 377a with respect to consensual male penetrative sex in private can be seen as a repudiation of its legitimacy , he said , adding it implies the government sees no legitimate state purpose in criminalising or prosecuting male homosexual conduct . the 1938 purpose became invalid in the eyes of the government in 2007 , he stated . the court must interpret section 377a in a way that does not violate the constitution , which depends on the nature of its inconsistency with article 12 1 , said mr chan . if the original purpose of section 377a no longer exists , it can be construed to conform to the constitution by reading it as a gender neutral provision that criminalises non penetrative sex of gross indecency committed in public , he added . court challenges to 377a to be heard in november the views of mr chan , who served as attorney general ag between 1992 and 2006 together with those of other former ags such as v k rajah and walter woon , as well as current deputy ag hri kumar nair are being cited by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt rights activist roy tan , who filed a challenge against the constitutionality of section 377a in court in september . dr tan , a retired general practitioner who helped organise the first pink dot event in 2009 , is one of three people who have filed court challenges against section 377a since last year . the other two are disc jockey
