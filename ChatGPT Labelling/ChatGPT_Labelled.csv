what about adoption eligibility and being recognized as the next of kin ?," what s stopping you from migrating to australia ? money , mostly , though if singapore doesn t change within the next 10 years then i will seriously consider migrating . the point is that you want to marry for love , which is not highly valued in singapore corporation really ? what about adoption eligibility and being recognized as the next of kin ? especially so when there are many singles by choice you mean singles but cohabiting ? most of asian culture has viewed marriage as a political and financial tool where marriage have been dictated by parents . sigh . . . i m not sure if that s true or not , but if it is , that seriously sucks . i guess i get what you re saying . cohabit instead of marrying , and that s another path i can take too , yeah . i will lose benefits like cheaper hdb and legal recognition though . but regardless of marriage or cohabiting , 377a must go .

"a closeted homosexual , when determining whether to come out or not , would only come out if he she is absolutely certain of their own homosexuality .","thanks for your reply ! honestly i was skeptical if you were a troll at first , but i m glad you replied . i admit that cases like what you refer to in your first few cases do exist . if you re in a minority community of anything , anyone seeking to leave can be seen as a traitor to people possessing extremist points of view . let me be clear . there are definitely extreme homosexuals out there . but there are many other normal , friendly homosexuals out there . many more , i m willing to wager . just as while christians with extreme points of view , muslims with extreme points of view , etc do exist , there are many many more normal people just like you and i . however , we re missing the point here . extremist gays not willing to let others go are not representative of the entire gay community , and just because they exist doesn t mean that every single gay out there is evil . and judging from your words , i m sure you ll agree that homosexuality in itself is not inherently sinful ? if you do , that that s exactly my point . homosexuality is not inherently sinful . as a bit of a tangent , let s examine the point about the gay traitors thing . the fact is , coming out as a homosexual is in itself a very difficult task , and there are many closeted homosexuals out there . if you want me to dig up the numerous articles out there about homosexuals coming out only to be bullied , cast out by their families that may not even be religious , i might add , so nothing against your religion here ! , i can . let s say 10 of all men in singapore come out as gay . a closeted homosexual , when determining whether to come out or not , would only come out if he she is absolutely certain of their own homosexuality . just go and google about coming out stories . it isn t a hmm im not sure if im gay , so i ll just try it out thing , it s an actual commitment . often a homosexual who comes out is very certain of their own homosexuality . so , maybe only 0 . 1 of the self proclaimed gay men in singapore are not confident of their own homosexuality . so these stories , while shocking , is not a common experience of most homosexuals . for someone to come out as gay and then come back out as straight is already not very common . yes , it is a problem that they re hounded by extremist gays , but the fact is it s a far bigger problem that gays experience discrimination from the government and from people . sorry for the tangent . onto your sidetrack . as a counterpoint , i ve never seen those against the gay agenda push their opinions with love . if you use the bible as an argument , you re labeling it as sinful . you re effectively saying that your religion dictates that that person belongs in a place of eternal torment because of their sexual orientation , and that you see nothing wrong with that . that sounds pretty hateful to me . i m not a christian , so i quote these from wikipedia s quotations from the bible leviticus 18 22 do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman that is detestable , leviticus 20 13 if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman , both of them have done what is detestable . they are to be put to death their blood will be on their own heads these are often quoted by christians as reasons why homosexuality is wrong . and . . . i don t know , the bolded text sounds really hateful to me . as for your opinion on gay people giving hateful arguments to push the gay agenda , i can t outright say that it s wrong since it s your opinion , but it s only your experience . and that s the nature of the internet , especially echo chambers like reddit and twitter where any dissenting opinion is shot down viciously you need not look further than the downvotes on your post . it s not the place for discussions like this . i cannot refute this because it s your own experience , but i hope me engaging you in this discussion would help although personally i m not gay . sorry , i don t understand what you mean . what i m saying is don t back your argument on the bible , because it s not something the other party believes . it s like arguing with someone with a different set of beliefs imagine a pastafarian trying to convince you the true god is the flying spaghetti monster simply based off his own bible . you don t believe in the flying spaghetti monster , while he does . to him it s only logical that the true god is the flying spaghetti monster , while to you it s an illogical argument . the same thing applies to using the bible to refute homosexuality .

i think that progress can happen faster than people think it could the most important step is for citizens to talk about it openly and proponents of same sex rights to not be afraid of backlash to their jobs and familial relationships .,"i would like to write about why i think google is doing something that s great for singapore . google has effectively helped several of the problems that lgbt citizens face in singapore the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship , and the lack of resources for grassroots movements in singapore to happen effectively . the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship lgbt media in singapore suffers from significant censorship and lgbt citizens have little say in how their life is fairly portrayed in mainstream media . compare and contrast the two different events below in 2006 , brokeback mountain passed completely uncensored into singapore . http news . bbc . co . uk 2 hi entertainment 4716610 . stm however , in 2007 , we have censorship of gay sex scenes in a small local movie festival . http pluralsg . wordpress . com 2007 04 24 gay sex scenes in local movie solos censored although i may stand corrected on the details , the article mentions that more graphic scenes that were not lgbt generally passed uncensored . but the biggest problem i have is with the guidelines on lgbt censorship in singapore . this problem can be seen directly from the bbc article on brokeback mountain singapore s media content director said ang lee s film was passed as it did not promote or glamorise the lifestyle . the idea of censoring media that promotes or glamorizes lgbt issues hosts the problem of whether media showing homosexuality as a normal occurrence constitutes as promoting or glamorizing . for example , the bbc article references that but in 2004 , taiwanese film formula 17 , which was about two teenage boys falling in love , was banned because it portrayed homosexuality as normal , and a natural progression of society . you can see that the reason for censorship is completely different the movie was censored because it showed someone living a normal lgbt life if you could somehow call it that way . and if you seriously consider something innocuous as this as a promotion or glamorization of lgbt lifestyles , then honestly , what exactly can pass the censors for lgbt citizens to get their message across that lgbt citizens are people too ? either way , the directive for censorship is incredibly vague and leaves plenty of room for the censor boards to do whatever they want , or the censor boards are simply being inconsistent with their censoring . these are both troubling conclusions . the lack of resources in grassroots movements in singapore for those in this thread who are worried that google is simply using its corporate clout to lobby the singapore government , the article states that that s not what google is trying to do their strategy involves developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . http dot429 . com articles 2012 07 06 google wants the world to legalize love google s strategy is not so much of lobbying the government directly so much as developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . i find this heartening because i ve attended lgbt support groups in singapore and see that they are sorely lacking on funds to do something impactful . the people who work there are definitely passionate about improving the lives of lgbt singaporeans a key part of oogachaga one of the support groups is to provide support for lgbt singaporeans to re connect with their families because of the fear of being ostracized when coming out . while i think this a great cause to support that appeals to the family first mentality of singaporeans , they don t have quite the funds to extend their reach to most singaporeans . considering the last event i went to had about 25 young adults attend , this is really small when you consider that singapore has more than 4 million citizens . google and barclays were the largest sponsors of pink dot 2012 a grassroots movement that has become very successful , although it s an event where 99 of the participants are lgbt citizens . i went to the last one and although there were supporting families who came , they were few and far between . conclusion overall , i think the move by google and the support provided by citi and ernst young gives me some hope that same sex rights can be established in my generation . i think that progress can happen faster than people think it could the most important step is for citizens to talk about it openly and proponents of same sex rights to not be afraid of backlash to their jobs and familial relationships . google is definitely helping here .

section 292 criminalizes the procession of pornographic materials , but as it is also rarely enforced , does it constitute of institutional discrimination of people who watch and download porn ? will i be fired from work , kicked out of house because the government legalized institutional discrimination towards people who love porn ? no ? same for 377a . so you don t care cause it technically doesn t affect you since i assume you are a post op transgender ? ok but other people do care that gay man can be charged for having sex with consent . liberals and activists love to claim gay discrimination in singapore . in an interview with buro 247 , writer and activist yi sheng ng claims , as a community that faces discrimination , where if our identities are known we face the risk of being bullied at school , abused in our families , and fired from work , we can t just sit back and wait for society to become nice . really ? the community faces discrimination ? doxxed ? bullied in school ? abused at homes and fired from work ? which third world part of singapore do you live in ? let me know , i ll investigate personally . eh there are so many cases and anecdotes of lgbtqs being bullied in school , kick out from their house , shun from the community , especially a religious one . there is even a shelter for homeless transgender who are kicked out and hotlines and counseling services for lgbtqs . yes , discrimination towards the lgbt exists , it exists in individualized employers , traditional families and social and religious groups . however there is barely any institutional homophobia nor discrimination towards gays in singapore . come on gays , let s not just make it all about you . yes , racial , age and religious discrimination exists , and the ministry of manpower and the tripartite alliance for fair and progressive employment practices tafep have their relevant legislation and guidelines on handling discrimination , and to ensure hiring practices that are fair and based on meritocracy and non discriminatory practices . facing discrimination at your workplace ?

where is the action to translate into a concrete action for the collective wishes of the lgbt community , ie , repell 377a and to legalize gay marriage ? what next for the lgbt individuals in singapore ? nothing changes . the government allocated hong lim park as a speaker s corner for singaporeans to gather and to host events the only designated spot in singapore . as the government knows , singaporeans need an outlet to vent off steam , just as much the pubescent 13 year old teen sneaks his elder brother s porn stash into his room to vent every once in a while . and that s exactly what pink dot is doing an annual venting of steam . 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 worth of community donations every year ? yup , they go to av sound systems , equipment rental , apparels and decorations , so that you can make it a grand party to get together and rah rah . so at the end of it , where do the funds go ? how about any towards at risk groups for the lgbt community ? and when the last confetti is tossed and the last pink champagne popped , what happens next for the lgbt community ? nothing . it s like an sg50 party year after year after year . fair enough if you don t feel that it helps , although some may argue that the fact that it has become popular means that the government has taken note of it and have to be more wary when reviewing such laws . it may take some time , but it is entirely possible they might with enough public pressure . it also shows lgbtqs that hey people in singapore do care about you and do want to ensure that you have equal rights as other singaporeans . also , it fun to piss off the waapd crazies . want to help the plight of the lgbt community in singapore ? put your money to real causes to help the marginalized lgbt individuals . there are much more worthy causes in singapore , see project t , a shelter for homeless transgenders in singapore oogachaga , a counseling and personal development agency for lgbt individuals . pink dot ? nope . oh wait , didn t you say that discrimination against lgbtq wasn t that serious , so why have such organizations ? oh btw , i believe oogacha sp is a sponsor and pink dot does highlight what they do to the public . finally , there s nothing proud to be gay just like there s nothing proud about being straight . if you are gay , you are just as normal as the next straight guy , why do you need a event to celebrate being gay ? how about let s make july hetrosexual pride month ? no ? i personally do not need pink dot nor a gay pride parade because i live with pride everyday of my life and surround myself with friends and loved ones . i am proud of my career achievements , my life experiences , and not because of my identity . i don t need an annual virtue signalling parade to make me feel good about who i am . the fact is , i am a singaporean first , and a transgender second . i would rather be celebrated for the former than for being different as the latter . pink dot this year ?

the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage .," it is not marriage calling something marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order

"so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society ."," the moe vs . trans debate has nothing to do with culture wars 2 feb 2021 top image still from video speaking in parliament on monday , education minister lawrence wong said that schools can be flexible in making arrangements for students with gender dysphoria , and that our main focus is continuing to provide them with a conducive learning environment and to support their overall well being . he also added that issues of gender identity have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies , and that we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . this is the first time the issue has been addressed in parliament since a trans student , identified as ashlee , claimed that moe had interfered with her hormone replacement therapy on reddit . she also said her school threatened to expel her over it as well . following this , 5 individuals protested outside the moe building last week . in parliament , wong addressed and validated the challenging experiences of students with gender dysphoria , which is a step towards opening conversations on the matter . but by claiming that western gender issues could potentially divide our society , attention was directed towards vague forces rather than on placing accountability on key players in ashlee s story . everything about the debate is singaporean let s look at the claims made and the parties involved in the ashlee vs . moe debacle a singaporean trans student alleges that a singaporean government institution moe interferes with her medical treatment for gender dysphoria , which was diagnosed by imh , another public singaporean institution , while her local singaporean school threatens to expel her over it . every party involved is either a singaporean or a singaporean institution . from ashlee s lived experience in her school as a trans student , to the bodies involved in granting her transition , it is difficult to pinpoint any culture war , let alone western influence at play . don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery . ashlee s grievances were rooted in trying to maneuver the often hostile path to accessing medical treatment for gender dysphoria as a student . for example , she claimed that before commencing hormone therapy , her psychiatrist was told by moe that they needed to be consulted before treatment could proceed , and that to date , no approval letter had come . she also said that her school called for a meeting with her father , where she was told she would be expelled if any physiological changes from hormone therapy would result in her being unable to wear the boys uniform . ashlee s case is about medical and education policy in singapore . trying to blame or pinpoint western forces or ideologies is a distraction , as it does little to help us unpack why the gap in guidelines came to be , and how it can be rectified . the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented . if anything , comments about a culture war may only spark one where it doesn t exist . why are we still talking about ashlee s story ? the reason why students protested outside moe last week and why netizens continue to discuss ashlee s story is because no definite conclusion has come of her case , not because of an ideological debate . if you look at discourse online and even the comments under her most recent post on reddit , netizens don t seem to be so concerned with whether being trans or undergoing hormone therapy is right or wrong , but rather , with picking apart the claims made on both sides . no official investigation has been launched , and while moe refutes the students claims , the public has been given no definitive answer about how the situation was handled . one voice that remains surprisingly silent in this time is that of ashlee s doctor , who could instantly help clarify the matter and put an end to online speculation . so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society . share with us your thoughts on this story at community . co . if you haven t already , follow rice on instagram , spotify , facebook , and telegram . author edoardo liotta 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",02-02-2021 17:51,Reddit,trans,0

"she said well obviously the bible doesn t approve of it , and that there s been no proof that homosexuality is an inborn biological trait .","i actually did some of my own csi into this programme a few months ago . i called the church number and inquired about this ministry , and the lady on the line actually passed me the contact number of the gay conversion therapist herself . i actually called her and we had an hour long conversation about what she does . it was enlightening in the worst way possible and here are some key takeaways 1 i asked her about the demographics of the people she sees . she told me most of her patients are young gay men in their late teens and early twenties . most of them come from christian backgrounds and attend church and were referred to her via word of mouth . 2 i actually asked her if she saw more gays or lesbians . interestingly , she told me that the people who see her don t call themselves identify as gay or lesbian , they refer to themselves as struggling with same sex attraction . she told me that people who identify as gay or lesbian don t go for conversion therapy . 3 i asked her to tell me more about herself , her age , qualification etc . she is in her thirties , with a bachelor s in psychology from sim , and received further training from counselling and care centre ccc . the ccc is a non profit organisation providing counseling services that is affiliated with the national council of social service ncss which is a governmental organisation . this was shocking as counsellors therapists if i m not wrong need at least a master s degree to legally practice as counsellors or psychologists . so the gay conversion therapist was unqualified . 4 i asked her about the success rates . she said that turning them straight isn t actually the goal , and that most don t become straight afterwards . bingo . straight from the horse s mouth . she said it s more about managing the desires and feelings . 5 i asked her about how she she goes about doing it . basically it was religious talk therapy with bible reading and prayer thrown in . 6 i asked her about her views on homosexuality . she said well obviously the bible doesn t approve of it , and that there s been no proof that homosexuality is an inborn biological trait .

"don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery ."," the moe vs . trans debate has nothing to do with culture wars 2 feb 2021 top image still from video speaking in parliament on monday , education minister lawrence wong said that schools can be flexible in making arrangements for students with gender dysphoria , and that our main focus is continuing to provide them with a conducive learning environment and to support their overall well being . he also added that issues of gender identity have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies , and that we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . this is the first time the issue has been addressed in parliament since a trans student , identified as ashlee , claimed that moe had interfered with her hormone replacement therapy on reddit . she also said her school threatened to expel her over it as well . following this , 5 individuals protested outside the moe building last week . in parliament , wong addressed and validated the challenging experiences of students with gender dysphoria , which is a step towards opening conversations on the matter . but by claiming that western gender issues could potentially divide our society , attention was directed towards vague forces rather than on placing accountability on key players in ashlee s story . everything about the debate is singaporean let s look at the claims made and the parties involved in the ashlee vs . moe debacle a singaporean trans student alleges that a singaporean government institution moe interferes with her medical treatment for gender dysphoria , which was diagnosed by imh , another public singaporean institution , while her local singaporean school threatens to expel her over it . every party involved is either a singaporean or a singaporean institution . from ashlee s lived experience in her school as a trans student , to the bodies involved in granting her transition , it is difficult to pinpoint any culture war , let alone western influence at play . don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery . ashlee s grievances were rooted in trying to maneuver the often hostile path to accessing medical treatment for gender dysphoria as a student . for example , she claimed that before commencing hormone therapy , her psychiatrist was told by moe that they needed to be consulted before treatment could proceed , and that to date , no approval letter had come . she also said that her school called for a meeting with her father , where she was told she would be expelled if any physiological changes from hormone therapy would result in her being unable to wear the boys uniform . ashlee s case is about medical and education policy in singapore . trying to blame or pinpoint western forces or ideologies is a distraction , as it does little to help us unpack why the gap in guidelines came to be , and how it can be rectified . the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented . if anything , comments about a culture war may only spark one where it doesn t exist . why are we still talking about ashlee s story ? the reason why students protested outside moe last week and why netizens continue to discuss ashlee s story is because no definite conclusion has come of her case , not because of an ideological debate . if you look at discourse online and even the comments under her most recent post on reddit , netizens don t seem to be so concerned with whether being trans or undergoing hormone therapy is right or wrong , but rather , with picking apart the claims made on both sides . no official investigation has been launched , and while moe refutes the students claims , the public has been given no definitive answer about how the situation was handled . one voice that remains surprisingly silent in this time is that of ashlee s doctor , who could instantly help clarify the matter and put an end to online speculation . so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society . share with us your thoughts on this story at community . co . if you haven t already , follow rice on instagram , spotify , facebook , and telegram . author edoardo liotta 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",02-02-2021 17:51,Reddit,trans,1

proponents of gay marriage always argue that marriage is a social construct .,"apologies for a day late reply , was busy . there s alot of angsty downvoters who don t even dare to participate in discourse . you guys are the definition of circlejerk , and the reason why we can t have nice discussions on reddit , grow up please . singapore is a secular nation . marriage is not a religious one but a civil institution as per singaporean law . churches will also not be forced as it is in the us to perform same sex marriages . i never said we weren t a secular nation . i wholly agree we are a secular nation , and i detest people on the white shirt camp who invoke the bible to denounce gay marriage because it s against their beliefs . yes , churches will not be forced , but in the us , those who upset the gay community will face huge budget cuts , threatening their very survival . technically , they are still allowed to reject the marriage of gay couples . while facing minor consequences of course . can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being discriminated against i don t believe in discriminating against gay people . i treat them as fellow human beings . those who discriminate against them are doing so out of fear , and i abhor such practice . would anyone be fine with not having equal rights ? i assume the right you are talking about is the right to marry . this really frustrates me . marriage isn t a right , it s a privilege . which is why in singapore or anywhere in the civilised world , both parties must consent before a marriage licence can be issued . if marriage regardless of the sex was truly a right , we d have a shit ton of problems . we don t have the right to marry animals for example . and this privilege is decided by the state . proponents of gay marriage always argue that marriage is a social construct . this lends even more credibility to the argument that marriage is not something we should inherently be given , it is simply a privilege and a standard we humans have invented , and set to adhere to . are they advocating that christians be stripped of their basic rights a group that actively calls for another to have less rights again , marriage is not a right . unless you are talking about the right to be an individual , the right to be treated as a fellow human being . then what i have written above already addresses this . i don t think the majority of white shirts are advocating discrimination of gays , those who do are the religious zealots , and a convenient straw man for the pro pink dot to attack . would you give anti vaxxers or climate change deniers the same legitimacy these are debates that are fundamentally different in the fact that they do not involve social constructs . let me explain further . we don t give anti vaxxers legitimacy because it is scientifically untrue . if white shirts argued that homosexuality is unnatural , i wouldn t be giving them any legitimacy either , because it has already been scientifically proven it does occur in nature . however , the issue at hand is whether homosexuals should be granted marriage . and this is a social construct , something that science has little authority in . therefore yes , we have to grant the anti gay movement legitimacy because this isn t a science debate , this is a social debate that involves an institutional standard we have believed in and referenced for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . no one s saying homosexuality is a fabrication . but people are saying that marriage should not be extended to include homosexuality . people have followed the traditional construct of marriage for hundreds of years , and allowing homoesexuals to marry on the basis of sexual attraction trivialises this institution . think of it as christianity and buddhism if a bunch of buddhists decided to mix the 2 beliefs together and then proceed to tell christians that they should expand their definition of christianity to include them , aggressively asserting that it is their right to be recognised by christianity while calling others who oppose them as bigots and narrow minded , most people would disagree . because in this scenario you shouldn t be trying to identify with a religion , you have essentially created your own . coincidentally you brought up the point about being antagonistic , but can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being told their narrow minded definitions of marriage should coalesce with the idea of same sex marriage something born out of sexual attraction ? i haven t once invoked a non secular argument , and i believe that the secular case against gay marriage can be made . edit formatting",11-06-2016 22:56,Reddit,gay marriage,0

. the petition allegedly collected 10 , 000 signatures in three days , and was significant enough to warrant a mention by our minister for law , k shanmugam , in his statement regarding the event . interestingly enough , this petition was posted on a site called citizengo , which has strong ties to european far right political networks . the site is full of petitions advocating for the rollback of lgbtq , abortion , and gender equality rights all over the world , ranging from the cayman islands and iran to ireland and canada . they are also iconic in many parts of the world for the money they put into their sloganeering freespeechbuses , which have made their way across boston , rome , and even nairobi . citizengo itself is based in spain , and has ties to the far right vox party , as well as other ultraconservative religious figures and politicians throughout europe and the us . using this site to collect signatures for local singaporean political issues is , in fact , a clear case of foreign interference . citizengo has a very clear political agenda , and there are no checks or methods of authentication to verify the user s nationality or country of origin . one of us entered fake personal details and listed our location as slovakia , complete with a fake postal code . the signature was successfully accepted . the anti lgbtq movement here frames its arguments in terms of fighting against foreign intervention , claiming to represent asian values or the true singaporean . yet , this petition points to how their rhetoric and strategies are heavily borrowed from the west . in fact , members of the public have no way of knowing how many signatures were actually registered by local singaporeans . in comparison , last year s repeal 377a petition , which recorded 50 000 signatures , ensured the integrity of its petition by using gopetition , which required signatories to declare their postal code and nationality . the numbers recorded in that petition not only reflected the ground better , but also allowed it to be submitted to the penal code review committee and local members of parliament . the pro lgbtq camp is constantly challenged for not being singaporean enough . thio li ann memorably said in 2007 that repealing 377a would be copying the sexual libertine ethos of the wild wild west . in recent years , groups like we are against pinkdot in singapore frequently bought up the presence of mncs sponsoring pink dot as a form of foreign interference , which may have led to the 2016 ban on foreigners and foreign funding for events that take place in hong lim park , including pink dot . the spectre of foreign interference looms large over any discourse promoting lgbtq rights , to the point where we miss the reality that the anti lgbtq movements are just as influenced by foreign discourse , if not more so . a quick glance through we are against pinkdot and singaporeans defending marriage and family brings up dozens of posts bashing , amongst other things , american politician mitt romney and swedish environmental activist greta thunberg . despite representing asian values , these pages fixate on the rhetoric of american politics , far more so than lgbtq pages such as the pink dot facebook page . the discourse of lgbtq rights and speakers being foreign funded ultimately obscures from the public eye the relationship between global ultraconservative movements and local anti lgbtq movements . with the upcoming 377a court challenges , we should remain cautious to the fact that foreign and local are fundamentally unstable categories , especially in a country like singapore , which is so open to the flow of people and ideas from all over the world . what used to be foreign is now suddenly local , as we can see with the history of section 377a itself a law enacted by the british colonial government . for one group to claim to be more local over another group being foreign is a futile gesture . this does not mean we have to abandon these concepts altogether . rather , we must critically engage with individual cases and not assume localness or foreignness . in citizengo s case , claims to singaporeanness provide a veneer of legitimacy where there is none . nobody in the lecture theatre where dr . guruswamy spoke was under the impression that she was singaporean or commenting on singaporean politics . in contrast , the citizengo petition repeatedly frames itself as a representation of local voices speaking out against murky , hidden foreign agendas . if we are to go with the anti lgbtq camp s definition of foreign interference , this could well be its ultimate manifestation . author ai huy luu and yogesh tulsi 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",17-11-2019 11:12,Reddit,377a,0

"the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented ."," the moe vs . trans debate has nothing to do with culture wars 2 feb 2021 top image still from video speaking in parliament on monday , education minister lawrence wong said that schools can be flexible in making arrangements for students with gender dysphoria , and that our main focus is continuing to provide them with a conducive learning environment and to support their overall well being . he also added that issues of gender identity have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies , and that we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . this is the first time the issue has been addressed in parliament since a trans student , identified as ashlee , claimed that moe had interfered with her hormone replacement therapy on reddit . she also said her school threatened to expel her over it as well . following this , 5 individuals protested outside the moe building last week . in parliament , wong addressed and validated the challenging experiences of students with gender dysphoria , which is a step towards opening conversations on the matter . but by claiming that western gender issues could potentially divide our society , attention was directed towards vague forces rather than on placing accountability on key players in ashlee s story . everything about the debate is singaporean let s look at the claims made and the parties involved in the ashlee vs . moe debacle a singaporean trans student alleges that a singaporean government institution moe interferes with her medical treatment for gender dysphoria , which was diagnosed by imh , another public singaporean institution , while her local singaporean school threatens to expel her over it . every party involved is either a singaporean or a singaporean institution . from ashlee s lived experience in her school as a trans student , to the bodies involved in granting her transition , it is difficult to pinpoint any culture war , let alone western influence at play . don t forget , singapore legally recognises trans individuals , and they are allowed to change the sex on their ic after hormone treatment and or surgery . ashlee s grievances were rooted in trying to maneuver the often hostile path to accessing medical treatment for gender dysphoria as a student . for example , she claimed that before commencing hormone therapy , her psychiatrist was told by moe that they needed to be consulted before treatment could proceed , and that to date , no approval letter had come . she also said that her school called for a meeting with her father , where she was told she would be expelled if any physiological changes from hormone therapy would result in her being unable to wear the boys uniform . ashlee s case is about medical and education policy in singapore . trying to blame or pinpoint western forces or ideologies is a distraction , as it does little to help us unpack why the gap in guidelines came to be , and how it can be rectified . the foreign interference in question only makes us look away from the immediate concern at hand which is that singaporeans with gender dysphoria , a recognised medical condition , need added structural support to be implemented . if anything , comments about a culture war may only spark one where it doesn t exist . why are we still talking about ashlee s story ? the reason why students protested outside moe last week and why netizens continue to discuss ashlee s story is because no definite conclusion has come of her case , not because of an ideological debate . if you look at discourse online and even the comments under her most recent post on reddit , netizens don t seem to be so concerned with whether being trans or undergoing hormone therapy is right or wrong , but rather , with picking apart the claims made on both sides . no official investigation has been launched , and while moe refutes the students claims , the public has been given no definitive answer about how the situation was handled . one voice that remains surprisingly silent in this time is that of ashlee s doctor , who could instantly help clarify the matter and put an end to online speculation . so far , over 300 teachers , social workers and counsellors have signed a petition calling on moe to implement clear policy supporting the livelihoods of trans students in schools , because what this case has illuminated is a structural shortcoming not one of culture wars , nor one of society . share with us your thoughts on this story at community . co . if you haven t already , follow rice on instagram , spotify , facebook , and telegram . author edoardo liotta 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",02-02-2021 17:51,Reddit,gender dysphoria,1

"it would be very unwise for the government to repeal section 377a until and unless there are robust safeguards in place , especially for the sake of our children .","section 377a of the penal code , which criminalises acts of gross indecency between males in public or private , is one of the most controversial topics in singapore today . some consider the law to be outdated and discriminatory against people who identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq , et cetera . others who favour retaining section 377a consider the law to be a critical symbol of singapore s mainstream values on marriage and family , as well as sexuality and gender . apart from law and policy , the debate also has implications on a wider question of social harmony how can people with vastly differing viewpoints coexist side by side in singapore society , without resulting in clashes or conflicts over deeply held values ? with these issues in mind , we consider what the best way forward is . since we started reading and writing about this matter , we have realised that children and youth are the most vulnerable in this great tussle of value systems . foreign news reports tell of young children being made to learn that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , that gender confusion an often conflicting and painful experience is not just normal , but should be celebrated and accompanied by irreversible treatment from a very young age . these practices may be harmful to children . for example , sweden has largely banned the use of puberty blockers to treat gender confused children , owing to harmful side effects , and the united states authorities have recently warned of side effects such as symptoms of brain swelling . children are also taught that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , and encouraged to be sexually experimental since all sexual behaviours are equal , despite the science showing that some behaviours are riskier than others . in singapore , we already have local examples of school going children encouraged to use gender pronouns in controversial ways and young teenagers identifying as pansexual and the alienating or bullying of those who disagree . marriage , family , children and societal values so what has repealing section 377a to do with this ? as the only law that retains a distinction between heterosexual and homosexual behaviours , its existence , on principle , restrains advancing lgbtq activism that contributes to a hyper sexualised environment and a disproportionate focus on sexual and gender identities . its non enforcement allows our fellow lgbtq citizens to engage in such sexual behaviours without government intervention . but many activists have made clear their intent to go beyond repeal and push for , among other things , same sex marriage and controversial sexuality education . however , to have fruitful and honest public debate on these other issues , it is crucial for those with contrary views to resist strong international pressure such as through diversity policies in global multinational corporations and the immense intimidation on social media . if section 377a is repealed , the ground will only become further divided and civil dialogue harder to achieve . activists have called the threat to family a myth , saying that the repeal will not cause a breakdown of marriage in terms of divorces . however , while existing individual marriages may not break down , marriage and family as social institutions with public importance will be affected . it is critical that social policy continues to prioritise the best interests of children , whenever possible . decades of social science show that the best conditions to raise a child are when the child grows up in a healthy family with both a biological father and mother , who are in a stable and lasting marriage . at the level of state wide policies , if the traditional family unit is weakened , society will be weakened as well , with implications for social policy , welfare spending and criminal justice . we know how important it is to give children good homes to thrive in , and to involve both fathers and mothers in their children s lives because each plays a unique and complementary role in the parenting of their children . thus , one of us founded dads for life to reduce the adverse impact of fatherlessness including physically or emotionally absent or abusive fathers on children . the other continued his work in designing and delivering highly customised marriage and family development programmes for families at various stages of their life cycles , including helping former convicts to reintegrate into their families and society , as well as being a chief juror for an annual exemplary fathers award , which has gone a long way to inspire fathers in the community . on the other hand , in a same sex household , a child loses a connection with either a father or a mother . given that half of a child s dna comes from the father , and the other half comes from the mother , to say that two fathers or two mothers make no difference to the child is to put adults desires before the needs and rights of the child . this is on top of the ethical difficulties surrounding the ways in which same sex couples obtain children such as surrogacy , which objectifies children , and women who are surrogates . if there is no proper consideration of all these possible negative effects of same sex marriages and family , we put children at risk by entering uncharted territory at the level of public policy . the existing status quo on section 377a is based on a careful balance and a political compromise adopted by parliament in 2007 following an extensive debate . this political package to use the words of our apex court already achieves a precious and well thought out balance . it ensures that the norms and values on marriage and family will remain mainstream , while giving space for lgbtq people to live freely and contribute to society . best way forward seeing how the repeal of section 377a can have a far wider and deeper impact on our policies relating to family and children than we realise , what is the best way forward ? who should we be most concerned about ? the repeal of section 377a does not just affect the definition of marriage , but also has repercussions on the well being of children . therefore , children should be the first priority . and we believe the majority will agree . since children develop best in a stable family with their married biological parents , we should try our very best to promote and protect such a family structure . we recognise that society is imperfect and families are imperfect , but that does not mean we should not strive towards the ideal in public policies , while offering support to others who already find themselves in imperfect conditions . we must do everything we can to protect our children , and we strongly recommend the following enshrine man woman marriage in our constitution , to show how we cherish the time tested value of the natural family unit as a nation , and to protect against any attempt to redefine it . having it enshrined in the constitution the highest law of the land will ensure that it is protected for the long term , it can be amended only by a two thirds majority of parliament , and man woman marriage has the highest priority in law and policy . enshrining man woman marriage in our constitution is insufficient to protect children from being indoctrinated with controversial and age inappropriate ideas and beliefs on sexuality . to better protect children , we must enact new legislation . this ensures that all other related policies , for example , guidelines on media codes and sex education in schools , can take reference from this new legislation the way it is being done now , with section 377a maintaining the distinction between homosexual and heterosexual relations . alternatively , the same effect can be achieved by keeping section 377a , given that the provision has already been vigorously debated in parliament , with the stance taken that it would not be proactively enforced . if section 377a is to be amended at all , a possible amendment might be to remove the words in private . if this is done , traditional marriage and legislation relating to children must be in place . it must also be made clear that the section is retained in the amended form as an important signal as to the norm of heterosexual relations . we would like to stress that this is not about discriminating against those who identify as lgbtq . we further denounce any threats of harm to those in the community . disagreeing with certain ideas is not discrimination . the debate over section 377a is about much more than the repeal of a provision that is not being proactively enforced . more importantly , it concerns the well being of our children and our nation . it would be very unwise for the government to repeal section 377a until and unless there are robust safeguards in place , especially for the sake of our children . singapore is at a unique juncture in time , at which it can chart its own course that avoids the polarisation over lgbtq issues that has divided many societies in the west , maintain the commitment to family values that have helped singapore to thrive , and allow space for different groups to contribute to society . the current precious and careful balance has served singapore well , and we should decide wisely as we consider the best way forward on section 377a . jason wong is a former senior civil servant , and the founder of the yellow ribbon project and the dads for life movement . mohd khair is a local and regional trainer and consultant who has helped many parents , youth and families through designing , developing and delivering highly interactive training programmes for more than two decades . both organised the recent protect singapore townhall event to discuss the impact of repealing section 377a of the penal code . the views expressed here are in their personal capacity .

"there have been several legal challenges mounted against section 377a , though they have been unsuccessful .","the government is considering how best to balance ground feedback that gay sex should not be criminalised with the desire for singapore s current position on marriage to be retained . speaking to reporters on saturday july 30 , law and home affairs minister k . shanmugam said the government has had extensive discussions with different people on section 377a of the penal code . under this section , it is a crime for a man , whether in public or in private , to commit any act of gross indecency with another man , and carries a jail term of up to two years . but the law is not actively enforced and it is a position that has been reiterated by the authorities since it was discussed robustly in parliament in 2007 . mr shanmugam said the discussions have included religious leaders such as taoists , christians , muslims and hindus , grassroots leaders , singaporeans from different backgrounds , lgbt lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender groups , and others . many agree that men who have sex with each other should not be thrown into prison . gay sex should not be criminalised , he said . at the same time , most do not want any decriminalisation to cause other major changes . in particular , most people want the current position on marriage to be retained . the current position is that the law defines marriage as being between a man and a woman . people don t want that to change , said mr shanmugam . people also do not want any change to the current policies that take reference from this definition of marriage , he added . the government understands this view . we are now considering how best to achieve this balance . the two questions we are dealing with are therefore one , what is to be done with 377a and two , at the same time , we are also considering how we can safeguard the current legal position on marriage from legal challenges in courts so that it does not get challenged in the courts , like 377a was in a series of cases , he said . these matters ought to be discussed in parliament , and decided in parliament , and not decided in the courts , he added . speaking to reporters at the tzu chi humanistic youth centre on the sidelines of community events , mr shanmugam also urged people here to avoid taking extreme positions on the issue , and to work out differences calmly for the sake of the country . there have been several legal challenges mounted against section 377a , though they have been unsuccessful . in february this year , the court of appeal through a five judge panel , dismissed challenges brought by three men who argued that section 377a should be struck down . it ruled that section 377a will stay on the books but cannot be used to prosecute men for having gay sex . mr shanmugam was also asked about a recent town hall that called for section 377a to remain on the books until there are guarantees to protect the traditional definition of marriage and family . mr shanmugam urged moderation from both sides and to avoid extreme positions and demands . he said these events illustrate what the government has been saying for a long time that if one side pushes too hard , then there will be pushback . we have seen this happen in many countries . if it happens here in singapore , and we are a very small place , the ruptures will tear our social fabric apart , cause a lot of harm , he said . this is why the government has been advocating moderation , moving carefully , and not to push positions which can damage society , he added . passions can run high , people genuinely believe in one or another view with great intensity . we have to try and deal with issues with an open mind , open heart . avoid extreme positions and avoid extreme demands , said mr shanmugam . move forward and try and be united , work on our differences in a calm way , for the sake of singapore . https www . straitstimes . com singap . . . without comprising legal position on marriage",30-07-2022 00:00,Hardware Zone,377a,0

"the issue of whether to repeal section 377a of the penal code does not meet the very high bar for a nationwide referendum , said deputy prime minister and finance minister lawrence wong on monday aug 22 .","the issue of whether to repeal section 377a of the penal code does not meet the very high bar for a nationwide referendum , said deputy prime minister and finance minister lawrence wong on monday aug 22 . mr wong was speaking to cna a day after prime minister lee hsien loong announced that the government will repeal the colonial era law that criminalises sex between men . in his national day rally speech , mr lee described the move as the right thing to do , but added that the constitution will be amended to protect the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman to prevent legal challenges . the decision comes months after the court of appeal dismissed the latest challenges to section 377a , reaffirming that the law was unenforceable in its entirety until the attorney general of the day indicates a change in the prosecutorial policy . following the ruling , authorities held extensive discussions with religious leaders , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt groups , as well as singaporeans on the best way forward on the law . asked why the option of a referendum was not considered , mr wong said it is stated in the constitution that a referendum is required only when sovereignty is at stake . singapore has held only one national referendum so far , in 1962 when singaporeans voted on the merger with malaya . the bar for a referendum is set very high and repealing 377a is very far from reaching this bar , said mr wong . because we are repealing a law which the courts have already said we cannot enforce . and even as we go about repealing the law , we are taking steps to ensure that the current family and social norms do not change . so we believe this certainly does not meet the bar for a referendum . mr wong noted that a referendum may not necessarily provide a resolution on sensitive issues . citing britain s brexit vote in 2016 and scotland s independence referendum in 2014 , he said far from resolving the issue , finding closure and moving forward , these referendums have deepened divisions in their societies . still , the move to repeal section 377a has generated different responses and whether this may see the government paying a political price , mr wong replied that the government understands it can t please everyone all of the time and is focused instead on doing what is right . in this case , we are trying to do a limited , controlled repeal of 377a and to achieve a new balance that reflects societal attitudes while preserving unity , he said . we are limiting the change to what we believe most singaporeans will accept , which is to decriminalise sexual relations between consenting adults in private at the same time , we are retaining and upholding what most singaporeans want , which is to uphold our current family and social norms . so , we believe this package is the right balance to strike , the minister told cna . mr wong acknowledged that not everyone will be happy with the announcement , with some preferring authorities to move more on this matter , while others thinking that the government is going too far . but in the end , the government has to make a judgment and do what we believe is right for the wider good of singapore and singaporeans , he said . and i would say that in a society like ours where there are diverse and sometimes opposing views , it is not possible for any single group to have everything that they want . we have to learn to compromise , to arrive at solutions where most people are comfortable with and live harmoniously together , he added , describing this as the singapore way to deal with sensitive issues . no change to national policies mr wong also told cna that the government is fully committed to upholding family centred policies . the prime minister himself said this very clearly in his speech the pap people s action party government will not change the current definition of marriage . this will not happen under the watch of the current prime minister , and it will not happen under my watch if pap were to win the next general election , he said . likewise , the impending repeal of section 377a will not change national policies that rely on the current definition of marriage , such as public housing , education , adoption rules , advertising standards and film classification . earlier on monday , the ministry of communications and information said lgbt media content will continue to warrant higher age ratings . separately , the ministry of education said education policies and school curriculums here will remain anchored on singapore s prevailing family values and social norms . basically , the overall tone of our society will not change , said mr wong . the minister noted that beyond changes in laws and policies , there are also some concerns about the excesses of activism and advocacy from both pro and anti lgbt groups . some have given us feedback that they have been subject to discrimination , or even been harassed when they speak out and when they practice their faith and beliefs , he added . the government is monitoring this very closely and will take action against any acts of discrimination or harassment , mr wong said , stressing that there is no place for such behaviours in singapore . no one should feel threatened because of their religious affiliation . no one should feel threatened because they are lgbt . he urged people to exercise restraint and tolerance on this issue which he described as one where people feel a lot of emotions about . if one side were to push too hard , the other side will push back even harder , and we will end up splitting our society , the minister added . let us instead find ways to come together . learn to compromise , accommodate each other , focus on the common ground which we share , which is significant and continue to work at building an ever more cohesive and united society . the prime minister said on sunday that there will be a full debate on the matter when legislation is brought to parliament . given how this is a matter of public policy , the pap does not intend to lift the whip when the issue is debated in parliament , said mr wong when asked . the singapore parliament website described the party whip as the disciplinarian of a political party . the whip ensures that there are sufficient party members in the chamber to support the party s position and that members of parliament vote according to the party s line . occasionally , he may lift the whip and allow mps to vote according to their conscience , the website said . dr janil puthucheary , senior minister of state for health and communications and information , is the current government whip . even as we were to repeal this law , we are making sure that we are putting in place measures to make sure that it will not trigger further societal changes , mr wong said . from that point of view , this is really a matter of public policy , and we do not intend to lift the whip when this matter is debated in parliament later on .

"therefore , modern day christian intolerance of homosexuality is precisely that intolerance .","i have addressed this point in my previous thread on this subreddit , and i am repeating my response here what you consider correct and original interpretation of scripture is actually not a pure interpretation , but one that is based on the cultural mores of your time . why are there female pastors in the modern church even though the bible explicitly says they are not allowed to have authority over men ? scripture is reinterpreted because what is considered right and just also changes with time . yes , i am aware that modern christianity justifies the appointment of female pastors by arguing that 1 tim 2 is written for a specific cultural context . however , cultural context is not the reason paul forbids it the verses after tell us that i do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man she must be quiet . for adam was formed first , then eve . and adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner . 1 tim 2 12 14 to arrive at the conclusion that cultural context was the only thing holding women back from preaching , you d have to wilfully read against the immediate evidence that the text presents , which is that women cannot preach because women caused the fall of humanity . therefore , scriptural interpretation is never pure , but is always mediated by the social mores of the interpreter . to arrive at the contextual argument you pointed out , wouldn t the interpreter have to purposely ignore paul s justification that women aren t allowed to teach because eve led adam astray ? paul doesn t mention poorly educated women to arrive at that conclusion , wouldn t the interpreter have to look beyond the text ? therefore , the idea that interpretation is solely based on the text is suspect . therefore , the existence of female pastors is justified through revisionist readings of the new testament . by the same logic , one should be able to re read the bible in a way that permits same sex sexual acts . after all , our modern day context is one that is strongly supported by scientific studies that show homosexuality is normal , involuntary and harmless . therefore , modern day christian intolerance of homosexuality is precisely that intolerance . they could re read the bible to allow it , but they don t want to .

and we ll see how just insane it looks . and then we ll use your response to his made up comment , just to see how stupid it is . so you can see what it actually looks like from someone who lives in near norway to read this drivel . asian countries aren t all that great either . singapore s health care system is notably transphobic . all countries have their faults . . . . no matter what wikipedia and their sources say about how great singapore is when it comes to trans rights , what the trans community says themselves is entirely different . i am not sure if you ll find any english sources on this , but anyone who knows anything about trans rights in singapore knows that a lot of trans people have been refused by the public healthcare system , and those that are allowed to be treated by their strict standards tell horror stories about how horrible they ve been treated by the doctors at the only public hospital in the entire country that offers treatment . which basically means they can do whatever they want because the patients can t go anywhere else , including breaking laws . there is an ongoing protest that is trying to get the attention of the government , but so far no luck . . . . you are making wild assumptions and accusations about me that are incorrect , unwarranted and unfounded . seeing as you are a random person on the internet i didn t want to assume what languages you know besides english , and since i don t have any sources on this topic in english afaik no newspapers have picked up the story i didn t share any . the wikipedia article you shared doesn t have a lot of information , and the information it does have is very one sided with almost exclusively positive opinions . knowing differently about what it s actually like to be queer in singapore i can say that it s missing a lot of information . i mean . . . the guy doesn t speak norweigan . lives in singapore . but he knows what it s like being queer in norway ? please . meanwhile , my sister is married to a trans , and we live in sweden . and i ve unloaded so much data , if this was a porn , it d be a bukkakke fest . but no , the data can be ranked differently , and it s easier to trust a fellow singaporean in front of someone who , you know , actually lives in the country they re making claims about , right ? sigh . . . now imagine you defending with , here are some data and rankings showing that singapore is in fact not that bad . let s paste your reply here , then such rankings are based on multiple factors , such that a country could be great with lgbt rights but suck on trans healthcare . do you see how insane this reasoning is ? i hope comparing this phraseology , format of the comments , and context toward singapore , would allow you to see how insane it looks like when a foreigner are making unbased claims about their country . this sub is so xenophobic , and your attempt at rationalizing his xenophobic dog whistling is some next level idiocy . tell me that you can see how insane the other commenter looks when reading his comments after i ve merely exchanged norway to singapore i really need to know that at least one singapore guy in this exchange was not completely brain dead . in addition , he is the one making one heck of a claim , without any sources , but here i am being pressured and told my sources aren t good enough . what the actual fuck ! so if i say singapore is a shit hole , you re going to find a source of how it isn t before you engage in a discussion with me about it ? or are you just going to ask me for source ? like damn . it s also super hilarious that he says it seems your wiki article is rather one sided . . . yeah ! norway is literally one of the best countries in the world when it comes to trans rights , even according to trans communities themselves ! of fucking course it s one sided ! that s like going to the red crosses homepage and saying don t know if we can trust their philantrophic record , it s sort of one sided , no shit you idiot !

you are hate filled because you insist that trans women are men despite being told over months and provided multiple research papers that proved contrary .,"as lifted from another redditor scientists and public health officials agree that trans men and women , and nonbinary people are who they say they are . gender is separate from sex and has to do with cultural norms based on sex , meaning that sex , not gender , is assigned at birth . gender derives its meaning from the society in which one lives , meaning gender is a social construct . it should also be remembered that in many cultures and parts of the world that there are people who do not have any issue with being trans nonbinary , most notably many native american cultures allow a third gender commonly referred to as two spirit . sex refers to dna and what body parts a person has , however , just like gender sex is not binary . there are instances where a person is born with parts that suggest they re female and parts suggesting they re male . this is called intersex . the ancient greeks were right . additionally , chromosomes don t always determine a person s sex . there are also several organizations and government agencies that support the validity of being transgender , which include but are not limited to the american medical association , britain s national health service , and the world health organization . https www . politifact . com article 2021 mar 04 what equality act debate gets wrong about gender s https www . nhs . uk live well healthy body trans teenager https www . ihs . gov lgbt health twospirit https www . britannica . com topic hermaphroditus https www . lambdalegal . org sites default files publications downloads resource trans professional statements 09 18 2018 . pdf https time . com 5596845 world health organization transgender identity and if it is not medical consensus , why are hospitals even in singapore providing transitioning resources ? so now i m upgraded from transphobia to attacking trans women and hate filled just because i do not think that trans women and biological women are the same . strawman . you are hate filled because you insist that trans women are men despite being told over months and provided multiple research papers that proved contrary . at this point , you are being willfully ignorant and happily doing something that you know contributes to the high suicide rate of trans people . if that is not hate filled , i don t know what is . no , i don t hate trans . i think you are different but you are not a woman . do go on pretending to be a woman , just stop forcing your worldview on the rest of us . and yet , you force your worldview on us despite so many scientific articles and medical journals supporting our existence . how ironic . or is it only your worldview is accepted ? and that we should all be happy to suck it up and have less legal rights because of how you feel despite science disagreeing ?

you assert that the distinction i made between using the rationale to justify why homosexual conduct should be illegal and why the law should be upheld is illusory .,"you seem very angry , which is unfortunate for you . the use of bold text is particularly interesting . i will try to address your rather lengthy response in as straightforward a manner as possible , though judging by your tone , i suspect it may be futile . 1 . your first point is that my statement is inaccurate because it is not what the judge meant . my statement is not intended to convey what the judge meant , but rather the logical conclusion that follows from what the judge held . as you know if you read a lot of case law or practice law , a legal holding has precedential value . as a result , even judges with the best of intentions can deliver judgments that have terrible consequences when applied to different fact patterns or even very similar fact patterns in subsequent cases . using the argument that it is inevitable that classification will product inequality in varying degrees and that this does not contradict the principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the law as long as all persons in like situations are treated alike to justify upholding a law that makes homosexual conduct criminal opens the door to using the same logic to uphold other laws which criminalize the behavior of or otherwise discriminate against a group of people . this is not inherently wrong . for example , i support laws that criminalize pedophilia . an obvious distinction there is the harm resulting from the conduct . however , using the principle that some forms of discrimination by the state are necessary for the public good to uphold the law in question establishes a dangerous precedent that can be used to justify other equally arbitrary uses of the state s power to discriminate . it is not inconceivable that this holding could be used as support for an argument that a different law that adversely affects people of a particular race or national origin is a legitimate use of the state s power to discriminate . your example it s ok to stop malays having children so long as you apply this equally to all malays is actually a fantastic example of my point and i thank you for that . i am glad to hear that you believe that this is so outlandish that it would never be upheld . however , i am not as confident as you are . if singapore were to experience an extreme disparity in malay population growth and were to enact a one child policy that only applies to malays , i do not think it is inconceivable that the holding in this case could be used to support upholding that law against a constitutional challenge though hopefully the challenge would prevail . 2 . you asked why i left out race in my response . i left it out because i was responding to your statement that s aying that justice loh used the quoted rationale to justify why male homosexuality ought to remain illegal is inaccurate , which doesn t address my original comment concerning race . see 1 above for why race is relevant . 3 . you assert that the distinction i made between using the rationale to justify why homosexual conduct should be illegal and why the law should be upheld is illusory . that seems a bit disingenuous on your part given your understanding of the case but , in any case , i disagree . the point of my response was to establish that contrary to your assertion , i was not stating that the judge is saying homosexual conduct should be illegal because the state has the power to discriminate in certain cases as you effectively attributed to me , but rather that a validly enacted law that makes homosexual conduct illegal should not be struck down based on article 12 because the state has the power to discriminate in certain cases . there is a quite significant distinction between a judge dictating what the law should be and a judge dictating what laws may be upheld . contrary to your assertion , this is a distinction very often used by both lawyers and judges . i think the tone of your response is pretty over the top and borderline belligerent . as you said , we do not appear to disagree at a macro level , so consider taking it down a notch . i do not know you and i am not making any assumptions about you so i would appreciate the same courtesy .

"article repost slightly more than half or 55 per cent of singaporeans still support section 377a of the penal code , even as one in three singaporeans is more accepting of same sex relationships than he or she was five years ago , a new survey has found .","article repost slightly more than half or 55 per cent of singaporeans still support section 377a of the penal code , even as one in three singaporeans is more accepting of same sex relationships than he or she was five years ago , a new survey has found . the online survey by ipsos public affairs , an independent market research company , was conducted over a period of four days from end july to early august 2018 to understand the current social attitudes towards same sex relationships . a total of 750 singaporean citizens and permanent residents aged 15 to 65 took part in the study . when asked the extent to which they supported or opposed section 377a of the penal code , which is the law that criminalises consensual sex between adult men , more than half 55 per cent indicated that they supported it , while 12 per cent said they opposed it . sentiment varied according to gender , with males more likely to strongly support the law than females . singaporeans aged 15 to 24 were more likely to oppose the law , while singaporeans aged 55 to 65 were more likely to support it . singaporeans were also asked the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the statement i believe that singaporeans should be able to participate in same sex relationships . twenty eight per cent agreed with the statement , while 38 per cent did not . a 2014 survey of more than 4 , 000 singapore residents conducted by the institute of policy studies similarly found that singaporeans are largely conservative . in the study , 78 . 2 per cent of respondents said that same sex relationships were wrong , while 72 . 9 per cent were not in favour of gay marriage . however , 33 per cent of singaporeans in the ipsos study agreed with the statement i am more accepting of same sex relationships than i was five years ago , while 35 per cent disagreed . the survey results come as the question of whether the law would be repealed in singapore was raised after the indian supreme court struck down a similar section of the indian penal code last thursday sept 6 . since then , online petitions to keep it and repeal it have been started by separate groups of individuals . when asked about the indian ruling last friday , law and home affairs minister k . shanmugam said in singapore if you look at this issue , it is a deeply split society . the majority are opposed to any change to section 377a , they are opposed to removing it . however , he said a growing minority want to have it repealed . the government is in the middle , he added . last saturday , he said that whether section 377a will be repealed or amended will be a matter for parliament to decide . he added that depending on the legislation , public opinion is often relevant during policymaking in parliament . ipsos said the findings indicate that attitudes towards the issue of same sex relationships have changed and are likely to continue to change , albeit at a slow pace . this change was attributed to perceptions of shifts in singapore s social norms with respect to same sex relationships , increased conversations on social media and more direct exposure to same sex relationships . said ipsos associate research director robert mcphedran this research indicates that the normative values of singaporeans with respect to lgbtq lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer issues are gradually shifting . he added as has occurred in other countries globally , increased dialogue regarding same sex relationships has contributed to higher acceptance among singaporeans . this is particularly the case for the younger generation . nonetheless , as pm lee has previously noted , a social consensus remains far from being reached .

imagine 2 christians one vehemently against homosexuality and same sex marriage .," traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . again , this goes back to the problems of proposing that marriage should be measured by its reproduction potential . let me quote myself again marriage cannot be defined by its reproduction potential . if so , then thousands of heterosexual couples without children should not be allowed to marry . there are also countless heterosexual couples who plan to never have kids . do we ban them from marrying as well ? under the same logic , people who are infertile or above the age of child bearing should not be allowed to marry too , since reproduction is out of the question . also , in singapore s context , malay families traditionally have more children than non malay ones . given your reference , are you suggesting that malay marriages are superior to non malay ones because they are more ordered toward procreation ? you cannot keep redefining marriage to suit your narrative . marriage has never been about reproduction hetero sex is , and even that isn t its only purpose . marriage is about love and commitment between two persons . are you going to suggest that there be a law that bans all sexual activity which does not result in conception ? one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . again , i can bring up countless studies and examples if you wish to know more . countless books have been written by the children of same sex couples . in fact , same sex couples are a lot more involved in parenting . i have never heard of a same sex parent who hasn t read at least one book on parenting . have you read any books on parenting ? my parents have never done that . they probably don t even know books on parenting exist . are you saying my family did not provide the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of me ? because that s what you re saying . it imposes its acceptance on all society . this is a common fear among those who oppose equality , so i d like to bring some attention to it . no , it doesn t impose anything on you or me , for that matter . even when same sex marriage is legal , i will still find it icky . i will still let my sons know that pussies are more fun not sure what i ll do with daughters , honestly . legalizing it does not force you to accept it . if you have a problem with it , you can still express it . you can still preach against it in churches and mosques . you can stop your children from having gay friends or friends with gay parents , and you can still tell them how immoral and wrong it is . you can even refuse to make wedding cakes or take wedding photos for them . there is pretty much nothing you need to do to accept same sex marriages . by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . on the same stroke , by banning same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active discriminator . by banning same sex marriage , the state is saying these people are less of a human because marriage is for normal human beings only . should the state be able to do that ? should we allow the state to determine that a gay person is less of a human ? . . . punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . sorry to break your bubble , but this part of the article does not apply to singapore . we already have anti discriminatory laws at the work place . state employees who expresses beyond just personal disapproval will already be punished . same for expressions against gender , race , and religion . try going to your work place and announce i do not want to work with these women because women are stupid and see what happens . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences . . . i am not a christian . i am a straight man who believes , strongly , about equality and the benefits of a more equitable society . are you saying i am not a person of good will ? because that s what you re saying . are you saying i m betraying my conscience ? because that s what you re saying . also , if you do not want others to attack your christian morality , why do you , then , insist on attacking our non christian morality ? why do you expect homosexuals to betray their conscience ? why do you want to silence them ? gays are not forcing christians to stop practicing and believing in their faiths . no single gay person is saying there should be a ban on churches and jesus , in the name of homosexuality . why are you trying to impose your belief on others by using the law , in the name of christianity ? this , in essence , is the complete immorality of your position , which brings me to the point about your religion it offends god first , let me just ask the rhetorical question how do you know ? are you god ? second , as an atheist , and millions like me , and millions more who are non christians , we reject your god , either in its meaning , its existence , or both . you may not impose it on us with the law , because the law does not belong to you . but that s the beauty of it , because similarly , we cannot use the law to ban christianity , or ban you from practicing your faith , no matter how much some of us would like to . third , what about the fact that your god wants you to treat every man as his brother , and that you must never judge as only god can judge , and that god loves everybody ? imagine 2 christians one vehemently against homosexuality and same sex marriage . the other who accepts and loves everybody , including gays , as equal . each professes their actions in the name of god . who is right ? who s wrong ? do i throw them a couple of knives and let them fight it out , and accept the answer of the one who wins ? that is your dilemma . the interpretation of religion is , in and of itself , subjective . you may not subject your subjective interpretation of morality onto the rest of the population using the law , because that s what slave owners did . that is far more immoral than anything you have conjured up against same sex equality .

this reduced discrimination is certainly going to be better for their mental health .," so explain to me , how many lgbtq teens have committed suicide here in singapore ? any numbers ? people already are committing suicide here for other reasons than their sexuality . shouldn t they take more precedence ? you re making a false argument that we can only help one group of people . here s the reality removing 377a and allowing for same sex marriage would go a long way in making the lgbt community feel less discriminated against . this reduced discrimination is certainly going to be better for their mental health . given the 7 is a drop , but the rates are still higher because people still stigmatize them ? really ? yes . homophobia , while lessened , certainly still exists in the us . even the article isn t so bold as to state its all discrimination and they couldn t find any other factors . hooker administered three projective tests the rorschach , thematic apperception test tat , and make a picture story maps test to 30 homosexual males and 30 heterosexual males recruited through community organizations . the two groups were matched for age , iq , and education . none of the men were in therapy at the time of the study . unaware of each subject s sexual orientation , two independent rorschach experts evaluated the men s overall adjustment using a 5 point scale . they classified two thirds of the heterosexuals and two thirds of the homosexuals in the three highest categories of adjustment . when asked to identify which rorschach protocols were obtained from homosexuals , the experts could not distinguish respondents sexual orientation at a level better than chance . a third expert used the tat and maps protocols to evaluate the psychological adjustment of the men . as with the rorschach responses , the adjustment ratings of the homosexuals and heterosexuals did not differ significantly . hooker concluded from her data that homosexuality is not a clinical entity and that homosexuality is not inherently associated with psychopathology . this study has since been repeated and the findings have consistently been the same . please educate yourself on the scientific literature before lecturing people about arguing on fact . http psychology . ucdavis . edu rainbow html facts mental health . html the us has far more conservatives than singapore for sure and discrimination racism is way more prevalent there because free speech is evil and we have anti sedition laws . no hate speech here . you seem highly misinformed . anti sedition laws don t apply to the lgbt community . case in point the waapd group on facebook . so remind me again , how is it being lgbtq being more oppressed in singapore than being in the us again ? 377a and the lack of same sex marriage ? it s rather obvious , no ?

maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a .,"we all know that any developed country outside of sea region and ccp does not criminalised people just becus they are specifically gendered male and have sex with each other . even india does not criminalise . thats blunt sense moronic , to criminalise something specifically based on gender . apologies if you disagree . even india moves on from the ruling many years back . the way you are putting it , its like just because other countries are doing it , we should do it too . so if other countries are abolishing or has already abolished death sentence for drug smugglers , we should blindly follow ? blind following the blind ? with out the independence of mind ? shoudn t the final outsome , even if it results in the abolishment of the act , be made with the indepencence of mind ? at least justifty your support for the abolishment of 377a with better logic . majority of these less developed sea countries will properly side ccp in the upcoming war . so you are really just associating your ideal values with them . since the early 2010s , honestly people all over the globe dont really anti male homo people anymore . why again are you mentioning about the ccp ? they are the only ones against abolishment of 377a like laws ? what about those states where gay sex is punishable by death . quite a few of them around . and they fare worse then ccp in terms of gay rights . but no mention of it from you . but just solely on ccp . i wonder why . we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war . so you are spilling over your dislike of ccp in regards to those matters to this ? if you really feel that homosexuality is immoral for the sake of so called moral values , you wouldn t even criminalise just male people , male people specifically were targeted because people who make these rules are mostly male people and are just over paranoid that without these laws and ruling , they themselves will turn homosexual . there is a term called homophobia , this is what you sound like more rather than people preaching good people values . the part in bold , that s one of the worst logic i ever heard . i mean serious ? can see you are no longer logical . not sure what you are smoking there . what next ? law makers are coming are with anti robbery laws because they are afraid they might become robbers themselves ? then they might as well not have the law and enjoy themselves by making it legal fulfilling their desires or tendencies legallly rather then fighting against their innate desires , why go through all the trouble ? as for the homesexuality part being immoral . not sure why you brought up the immoral part . a celibate homosexual is more moral than a promiscuous hetereosexual . a better way to put it is , its against nature rather then immoral . heterosexuality is part of human evolution in terms of the continuance of human population . not to mention , those body parts when in unison , were not mean to perform those task , which is why proportionally there is a higher risk of contracting stds , hiv , monkeypox , suffering from incontinence etc . in gays then heterosexuals . . because nature did not mean those body parts for that . which is why i support maintaining status quo not further tightening of the law . by that , i mean the law existing in name to permeate the state of mind that gay sex is discouraged , even though the act was no longer stricly enforced while not actually in most cases punishing gay sex itself . which is i believe the most popular sentiment among the general population excluding lgbts it would have been better to strengthen or come up protective laws against depriving gays , lgbts who are out of the closet , of job opportunities , etc . rather then repealing the act . problems is , there are people like you who like to jump to conclusions . not supporting the repealing of the act gays should be punished heavily or homophobia blah blah . of course i am not ruling out the existence of such people . but there are different schools of thought even among those who do not support the repealing of the act . some take a more aggressive stance , some take a more middle ground . regarding good values , you have good values because you support repealing of the act ? seems like quite a loose definition of good values if so . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . not sure if repealing of the act , but embedding the defintion of marriage only between man and women into the contsitution , making it not challengable in court is exactly boost the international image , attract more international investments that u define . maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . nah , i don t take it personally . hope you seriously don t too . i am also fine that you are the judge of howthose who dun support repealing of the act are , traditionalists , suck at justifying and challenging , and not being able to accept new norms . after all , delusional or not , your opinions and sentiments must be superior to those that contrast to you and it is the universal truth . and yes , i believe you are not even a pro homo person after reading your post which is not even actually pro homo .

"both polygamy and incest ought to be banned precisely because it is usually not between consenting adults , unlike homosexual relationships .","1 . laws shouldn t be based on moral values that everyone agrees with . that s just mob rule . there s a reason why we have legal scholars , philosophers and ethicists . there are people who are actually experts in deciding what should or should not be legal . 2 . slippery slope . polygamy and incest are wholly irrelevant to the debate . but since you asked , here is the answer . both polygamy and incest ought to be banned precisely because it is usually not between consenting adults , unlike homosexual relationships . if you actually read the literature on why incest should be banned , it s because the power dynamics at home make it difficult for some persons to actually refuse incestual relations . hence , it is difficult to say when someone legitimately consents to an incestuos relationship or when they have simply been coerced into one . the same thing occurs for polygamy . the structure of social norms surrounding marriage is still lopsided where husbands usually have more power in telling their wives what to do . hence , polygamy is not usually consensual between all parties . however , theres nothing morally wrong about polyamory if every party in the relationship agrees to it . do look it up . i have not seen any peer reviewed argument against polyamory . 3 . i agree with the last point . because 377a is not enforced , repealing it does nothing for gays . however , i am of the opinion that parliament should not be able to tell the ag when to enforce what laws . that s just crazy . ag should prosecute all the laws of the land , not cherry pick . that sets a very very bad precedent .

there is a fundamental difference between a church that teaches homosexuality is not wrong .,"your nazi analogy is flawed . firstly , there is a fundamental difference between catholics and protestants . the very reason why protestants exists is because they reject fundamental beliefs of the catholic church , protested against them hence the name and started their own church . to put it plaintly , there s no such thing as a nazi who believes jews are equal . such a person belongs to a completely different category . next , you re linking being gassed by nazis with acts against lgbt . well then , did the germans who are not nazis , those who actually love and accept the jews , gas the jews by association as well ? just because they are germans even though they hold completely different beliefs ? there is a fundamental difference between a church that teaches homosexuality is not wrong . do not discriminate . god made lgbtq people this way . love one another despite differences . and a church that teaches homosexuality is unnatural . god hates homosexuals . it is an illness that can be cured . there is a fundamental difference between a group that accepts lgbt people and a group that actively holds anti lgbt campaigns and conversion therapy . i m curious as to why you would call out the former , and go as far as to say you re not particularly interested in other groups . it s almost as if you don t have an issue with anti lgbt , and your intention is to propagate falsehoods about religion . furthermore , support for 377a isn t exactly anti lgbt . if that s the case then shouldn t you call it sexist because it only applies to men ? anti lgbt would be opposing pinkdot , an event that supports all lgbtq people . has the local catholic or angelican church engaged in opposing pinkdot ? have they engaged in the wear white movement ? have they engaged in conversion therapy ? are they , as you claim , the biggest group that are anti lgbt ? if yes , where are your sources ?

this reinforces my opinion that you have not met a trans person in real life .," you simply cannot choose to live as your transitioned gender without having undergone medical transition , and expect there to be zero consequences . question , what do you think is medical transition . because i have undergone hormone replacement therapy which causes the largest change in how i look , making me look no different from other women . the one you are focusing on is srs which does nothing to my external appearance and is only there for my genitals which nobody should be looking at even in the public toilet . if you choose to dress and live as a woman well in advance of your medical transition , then the difficulty you face during the interim period was of your own choosing , no ? why not continue to dress and live as a man before medical transition , and use the appropriate bathrooms in the meantime , saving yourself and others any of this discomfort ? this reinforces my opinion that you have not met a trans person in real life . you do not seem to realize that trans women boy mode early in their transition to avoid the discomfort both for themselves and others . yes , you then have to deal with your own internal difficulties of sexual identity etc . but that surely is still the more sensible and reasonable choice , rather than making a ulilateral decision to live as a woman well before the medical and legal transition has occurred . it is gender identity . and you seem to be associating it as a choice rather than a treatment for something that causes so much discomfort and pain that suicide is preferable for some compared to staying in the closet . regarding your question of trans men going to the female toilet yes , i would still support it as long as they are still legally and medically female . if they need to wave their ics around to do it , so be it . i d much rather that than leave the choice in their hands . so i guess that means you prefer someone like this https pbs . twimg . com profile images 1144302067940392960 hu1zme3j 400x400 . png to be in the female toilet ? do you think him being in the female toilet causes more or less discomfort to others using the same toilet ? from my conversation with you , it is pretty obvious that you have zero idea of what a trans person is or how they look like . so what makes you so sure of yourself that you insist on proposing things that will cause discomfort to every other person ? it feels like you are focused so much on legal gender marker that you forget how appearance and other factors affect the so called discomfort . perhaps you would like to try volunteering at organizations that work with trans people such as transbefrienders to find out more about what actual trans people are like and the actual bathroom situation instead of going by your own imagination ?

i m against repealing 377a because the government will force me and my children to be gay .,"saw this article and wanted to get this out of my system . the writer s arguments are anything but well thought out . they rely on fallacious arguments and non sequiturs . lets take a look from the very top . the government maintains a position that all religious communities are free to give voice to their conscience in matters that have moral impact . people of religious faith have equal right to be included in rather than dismissed from the public forum of debate . some homosexual rights advocates argue that religious citizens should refrain from arguing that the state laws should criminalise conduct that they consider immoral . this line of argument actually contradicts the definition of secularism . for what they are really saying is you shouldn t make laws based on your morality , but on mine instead . just because something is immoral to the religious i . e . a sin , doesn t mean it should be criminalised . for example , the bible raises all sorts of sins which no sane person would criminalise , such as wearing mixed cloth and worshipping other gods . on a broader point , singapore in a classical sense can never be called a pure secular state because it allows certain anomalies to exist 1 . independent schools both primary and secondary that are set up and run by religious groups e . g . acsi , sji . these schools are directly funded by the state 2 . islamic family courts system enacted in 1968 under the administration of muslim actadministers muslim personal law in legal matters governing marriages , divorces , the nullity of marriages and inheritance in singapore . 3 . the common law system underpinning our whole legal system is rooted in the judeo christian philosophical worldview . in the seventeenth century , sir matthew hale declared that the whole bible made up the common law of england . in 1767 , lord mansfield qualified this only slightly by declaring , the essential principles of revealed religion are part of the common law . oh we aren t really a secular state so we should just make our laws according to religious lines this guy . if personal enjoyment , consent , and commitment are all that is now required to declare a sexual behaviour legitimate , then there is no reasonable basis for withholding public recognition of polygamous polyamorous , adult brother sister unions or even adult adolescent unions . a quarter of the way in and this guy slippery slopes himself into legislating paedophilia , while conveniently forgetting the part where children can t consent . it is galling for singaporeans , who have seen their country progress so well to now be lectured by an elite group of liberals that they are intolerant bigots . for no other nation in human history , since empirical records have been kept , has advanced as quickly as the little island nation . despite having virtually no natural resources , singapore has gone from being a third world country in 1965 to a first world country in less than half a century . the world bank recorded that the gdp of singapore has grown 3700 from 1965 whereas the usa only grew 300 . children from the least privileged backgrounds have risen from great poverty to achieve remarkable success . acute poverty is now rare in singapore . other measures of success are equally impressive . infant mortality has been reduced faster than any other society in the last 50 years . students in singapore now top the charts consistently in international tests . for instance , the oecd ranked singaporean children number one in the world in a recent global rankingof universal basic skills in mathematics and science . yet we are told that we are backward and intolerant . economic progress ! social progress . when others call us backward and intolerant , they talk about our social policies and human rights . yet he harps on and on about things that are anything but that . this guy totally missed the point . singaporeans have made clear repeatedly that the vast majority oppose any attempts to remove s377a . this majority has likely grown over the last few decades with the growth of conservative religions , like christianity , in the wider population . for those who advocate repealing s377a we must ask what moral standards do you appeal to that will persuade us that society s current moral consensus is wrong ? if you can t persuade the majority , what gives you the right to declare by fiat that your moral code must supersede that of ours ? because the basic human rights of gays are being suppressed by these laws ? because their homesexuality does not harm others ? because we should uphold the rights of the minority , especially when said rights do not harm others ? the majority of people in singapore recognize that the homosexual lifestyle is harmful for the individual and society in general . statistics abound from all over the world to back up that statement with drug abuse , sexual transmitted diseases , depression , suicide rates disproportionately affecting those in the non heterosexual population . oh yeah , totally due to the the homosexual lifestyle , and totally not because we keep oppressing them . life expectancy is considerably lower . citation needed . this is found to be universally true even in societies where homosexuality is celebrated and encouraged . homosexuality leads to vastly inflated risks of physical and emotional harm to the individual . families and society at large are then often left to pick up the pieces of such a destructive lifestyle . . . . all the three great abrahamic religions are crystal clear that homosexuality is always a choice that can be rejected . society is replete with anecdotal evidence from both secular and religious people , who have turned their backs on the lifestyle . the weight of scientific evidence demonstrates that it is not innate or congenital , like skin colour , but rather an aspect of our freewill . the gay gene theory has been overwhelmingly debunked ! straight up lies right there . also , i m gonna call out the homosexuality is a choice thing , as it is proven bullshit . most singaporeans are suspicious that the repeal of s377a would unleash a range of thorny problems that would deeply disturb the fabric of our society . they have seen from the evidence to date in other countries that it leads to mandatory indoctrination of our children in the education system , gay adoption , gay marriage , discrimination against employees who morally disagree with the homosexual lifestyle , and flamboyant gay pride parades . some have even found themselves fined or imprisoned for opposing homosexual practice . in his 2007 speech in parliament that advocated retaining s377a , the current prime minister , mr lee hsien loong wisely noted that to change the law would result in the reality that gay activists will push for more . mr ho peng kee , then senior minister of state for home affairs in 2007 , also noted that there was an inherent danger in removing s377a . he pointed out , whilst homosexuals have a place in society , repealing section 377a will be very contentious and may send a wrong signal that government is encouraging and endorsing the homosexual lifestyle as part of our mainstream way of life . i m against repealing 377a because the government will force me and my children to be gay . this guy , basically . nothing has changed since 2007 , save for the fact that singaporeans have probably become even more religious . there is no objective evidence that the world is a better place for the diminishing of the traditional family unit as the central building block in any of these western societies . our society has prospered and developed at an incredible rate by maintaining our core family values . ah yes , if it ain t broke don t fix it . except that now we have homosexuals telling us that it is broke and for good reason . so maybe we should start on fixing it ? honestly , this guy s arguments are full of shit and reeks of intolerance . would not recommend 10 10 , 2 7 with rice .

it s even more egregious that this only affects male homosexual intercourse .,"let me try to answer from the perspective of a straight ally . sorry if this is vague and rambling . s377a makes male homosexual intercourse illegal . i personally feel that makes a travesty of the idea that we re based on the rule of law . either enforce it or address it . it s even more egregious that this only affects male homosexual intercourse . besides the legal inconsistencies , lgbt couples do not have the option to access anywhere near the same level of legal recognition straight couples do . why should an lgbt couple have any less legal recognition than a straight couple ? basically the standard argument the government has used to justify its keep it illegal but do not enforce strategy is that society is not ready . thus part of the point of publicising pinkdot is to show the authorities that lgbt people are just as much a normal part of society as anyone else , and that first , hopefully the legal inconsistency with s377a can be resolved , and after that more progress can be made to treat lgbt people equally like any other citizen . i m a married straight man , and my wife and i have attended pinkdot regularly because we don t think there s any reason why lgbt people should be denied the same rights we have , and that we , as the sort of nuclear family unit which the government portrays as the building blocks of our society are cool with it . as for the idea that if someone was lgbt they would already be aware of their community , unfortunately that s not true . a lot of lgbt youth and even adults can feel very isolated , and many may experience bullying etc . pinkdot is a highly publicised venue where resources can be advertised . for example , a shelter for homeless transgender people was advertising at pinkdot . someone who is transgender , and perhaps , may have been kicked out by their parents may well have had no idea about the presence of such resources if not for these highly centralised events which allow for information to be easily disseminated . in the end it comes down to empathy i think . as straight people , engaging with the lgbt community helps us to understand that they re just people like anyone else , and deserve the same respect . finally , in my personal case , as an ethnic minority i understand what it s like to feel alienated to an extent in my own society . i m not trying to play the race card here . my point is that ethnic minorities are legally protected in a way that the lgbt minority isn t . thus its important to me to demonstrate solidarity with people who have less recourse to legal protection than myself . didn t get to go this year as my wife is heavily pregnant and standing for hours in a crowd wasn t a good idea . we ll be going next year and taking the kids though . edit oh hey , gold , thanks kind stranger !

it is a promise that could easily be revoked for 377a .," as a guy , being able to achieve orgasm , also means that some degree of sexual gratification was achieved . let s say a skilful girl was able to give a homosexual guy an orgasm . it might not be as good as homosexual intercourse , but it s not zero . kevin durant publicly offered to drink scarlet johansson s bath water . he hasn t been successful thus far , going by public record . that doesn t mean that he s given up on sex with anyone else . umm . . orgasm does not mean sexual gratification . it is your body s response to stimuli usually at the erogenous regions but you can still orgasm without enjoying it . if i m talking about weed , then it s much easier being an advocate for 377a , than weed . since only one of them runs the risk of a jail term . it is a promise that could easily be revoked for 377a . take note that they had also used other laws to conduct anti gay operation with a recent one being done in 2010 . also , 377a has been reported https sacc . aware . org . sg get involved your stories to prevent male sexual assault victims from speaking up . so it s not even about a law that isn t enforced . but about everything else after . so even overturning the law wouldn t satisfy the lgbtq community . now i can see why those protect s pore people talk about a larger agenda . while the lgbtq movement says it only doesn t want to be treated as criminals . it is the symbol of the discrimination faced by lgbtq people . is equal rights really a larger agenda ? would you be happy to live with the exact same constraints as us ? perhaps you would like to try it and see why lgbtq people are unhappy with the status quo ? racial equality is mentioned in our pledge enshrined in our constitution . yet it obviously hasn t stopped racism . so even if 377a was struck down , societal acceptance might not necessarily follow . but it did result in a huge improvement where we no longer have such severe racial tensions that would have resulted in racial riots . although racism is not fully removed , it is still a huge step from the past . now science can be used to prove if something might be harmful . but i ve yet to heard about scientific experiments , used to show , if something is ethical or not . in fact , i think that making conversion therapy torturous guarantees failure . the idea is has to be about making it pleasurable . else how does one convert ? but i don t think such experiments are allowed , in this day and age . and how do you propose that ? if you are so certain that conversion therapy works , why not do it on yourself . open yourself to the possible trauma that you propose on inflicting on others ? apart from our legacy british penal code . the barriers you mentioned are there , because it has the complicit support of the majority . most people want a traditional nuclear family unit . while the government wants these units to produce more babies , thus the incentives given to do so . untrue . most of the complicit support are just apathy with some vocal groups bringing in bigotry from western influences . if we removed every single neutral voices , there is a bigger argument for the repeal of 377a . it s not all difficulties , without any benefits . the lack of children means that gay households have more disposable spending power . it s the power of the pink dollar , that brought one of the largest annual gay dance parties to sentosa , once upon a time . so you are saying that there are benefits to being discriminated against ? there are childless straight marriages as well . and they benefit given that they can bto whereas a gay couple intending to stay together will have to pay the extremely high price for a resale and be locked out of certain regions too . where is the increased disposable spending power ? also take note that there is discriminatory hiring which results in lgbtq citizens usually being forced to only get low paying jobs . is that a benefit ? and for pink dollar , the companies profit off of it whereas lgbtq people gain nothing from it . following this line , maybe the lgbtq community can strive to make more money . which will improve their lobbying power . money makes everything easier . it s something our policy makers take into account . perhaps if we do not face discrimination during job hunts ? where disclosing that you re lgbtq will not result in an instant rejection or not getting the chance of an interview ? and ultimately , i didn t write our laws . nor do i plan my day , around making the lgbtq community miserable . neither the larger public , who have bread butter issues to stress about . and yet you consistently argue against allowing lgbtq people equal rights . you have spent hours on a work day arguing for something that will make the lgbtq community miserable . you are also not the only one doing this . you may view yourself as being neutral but the fact is that you do have an interest in making lgbtq citizens miserable with your promotion of conversion therapy and argument against the repeal of 377a . how would straight couples appreciate more competition for their btos ? so we straight up don t deserve housing as singapore citizens ? we all pay the same taxes , we all contribute to singapore , we should all get the same rights and chances at btos . there are so many childfree straight couples who get btos . should we then insist that all of them forfeit their housing to couples that have children ? if you truly care about the finite resource of btos , combating flipping of hdbs and preventing people from having more than one house would probably do a lot more than barring lgbtq people from bto . anyway , i m more than happy . to put the issue to a public referendum . because you know that the bigots are still vocal and a huge percentage are apathetic enough to be happy with continuing discrimination . would you be happy if we have a public referendum regarding your rights ?

"conclusion from 10 and 11 , the government should not support a policy of legalising same sex marriage ."," something undemocratic for the greater bad your opinion of the greater bad , you mean . for national policy ? when s the last time that happened ? let s say , for example , singapore switches to nuclear energy for more sustainable , green energy as a matter of national policy . singapore then plans to shut down some other power plants like , say , tuas power plant , when the nuclear power plant is complete . residents of tuas are concerned about the impact this could cause for tuas . is it not perfectly right for mps representing the west coast grc to voice these concerns in parliament ? if you think this is not right , what is the alternative ? should the concerns of the residents simply be unrepresented ? feelings are not fact ah , now i see . your idea of objective is to completely ignore feelings . that s not very objective . many singaporeans like durians . liking durians is a subjective feeling , but the fact that people like durians is an objective fact . why would you ignore objective facts about subjective feelings ? they re not irrelevant . people act based on feelings , and those actions change the world . that is fact . the government has taken these objective facts about subjective feelings into account before . in 1972 , singapore notices that firecrackers are really dangerous , and wants to ban them . however , the people like firecrackers . the government takes into consideration this fact about people s feelings , and the solution is that while firecrackers are still banned , they hold a chingay parade to boost the festive spirit , so that the people feel more festive during chinese new year . is this an objective decision ? of course . in fact , you don t really oppose the government using objective facts about subjective feelings . you linked a whole number of website that say that singapore s sentiments about lgbt are becoming more favourable to the lgbt . isn t that a subjective feeling that people have ? if the government were to use this to justify allowing same sex marriage , wouldn t that be using an objective fact about singaporeans subjective feelings ? so , would that be an objective reason ? of course . this clean separation of feelings and facts is not practical . feelings influence behaviours , which shape the objective facts . fact based would involve providing data as to prove that singapore is indeed too crowded and has too many immigrants . define too crowded . define too many immigrants . this is a subjective standard . to a xenophobe , one immigrant is too many , to a globalist , there is no such thing as too many . let s try another example . there are parents who are concerned that education is too competitive , and causes too much stress on students . good luck objectively defining too competitive . or , suppose a cyclist thinks that singapore needs to increase the number of parking spaces for bicycles , because it is currently very inconvenient to park a bicycle . good luck objectively defining what very inconvenient is . politics are not just about facts . they are also greatly about what values a society should prioritise and promote . inevitably , opinions about this are highly subjective . if you don t think so , go objectively prove what makes something very inconvenient . give one argument against same sex marriage sure , how about this 1 . singapore has a strong cultural link between marriage and children . 2 . removing this strong cultural link between marriage and children will result in less people having children . 3 . due to 2 , a strong cultural link between marriage and children 4 . same sex couples cannot have any biological children with each other . 5 . because of 4 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage will damage the cultural link between marriage and children . 6 . from 2 and 5 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage will result in less people having children . 7 . singapore needs more children . 8 . from 7 , it would be against the interests of singapore if less people have children . 9 . from 8 , a policy resulting in less people having children is against the interests of singapore . 10 . from 6 and 9 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage is against the interests of singapore . 11 . the government of singapore should not support a policy against the interests of singapore . conclusion from 10 and 11 , the government should not support a policy of legalising same sex marriage . i believe this is a valid argument , i . e . that it is logically impossible to accept all 11 premises and reject the conclusion . how do you find this argument ?

second , i use the term protestants generally simply because you have been using anglicans and catholics . it is long and tiring to have to say the other christians who are not anglicans or catholics , so i have used protestants . if you prefer another label that is convenient , i have no problems using that . thank you for confirming and proving my point . you have deep seated psychological issue that causes you to casually stereotype vastly different groups . here is what you said earlier you seem to be saying that hang on , the protestants are way worse ! they have their wear white campaign , and pray that it will rain on pink dot . you would rather further generalize and stereotype with protestant a 10 letter word , than use the acronyms of the groups that both organize wear white movement and have conversion therapy , both of which contain only 4 characters . essentially you are now saying angelicans , methodists , presbyterians , all of the seven local denominations actively participate in the wear white campaign . and your reasoning is because it is long and tiring . it literally takes less effort to actually not stereotype and name the actual groups . if that s not a prime example of stererotyping , i don t know what is . your psychological issue of casual stereotyping is propagating misinformation and falsehoods , and you need to stop . if you can t , i suggest you seek help , because people like you stir up dissent amongst peaceful relationships . by the way , the notion that not all protestants participate in or even support the wear white campaign , or conversion therapy . can simply be reversed to point out that not all catholics are opposed to wear white or conversion therapy . clearly , you will see variance in the nature of belief in any faith , so any discussion will necessarily have to encompass some degree of generalities . i m sure you recognize a fundamental difference between a group that teaches love and accept lgbt people and a group that teaches homosexuality is a mental illness . you even said it yourself that one is worse . so why are you still sterotyping both groups as one , while naming only the groups that are relatively more supportive and passive by not actually actively organizing anti lgbt movements , while refusing to admit you re willfully being obtuse by choosing to disregard the groups that are organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? i ve already explained that i still regard the differences as fairly minor , in the grand scheme of things . therefore you are admitting that you are sterotyping , and your intention is therefore to stir shit because you know and admit one group is worse than the other but you still support calling the group that is relatively more supportive and passive out and ignoring the group that is actively campaigning against lgbt . i know you re going to deny it , you can keep telling yourself that , but i really don t know how you sleep at night knowing that because you re too afraid to shatter your fragile ego , you refuse to admit that you would rather call the group that teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people out as the largest anti lgbt group while you completely disregard the actual group that organizes anti lgbt campaigns . to me , you are willfully spreading lies and misinformation that all churches have the same stand regarding lgbt , an issue that my lgbt friends and family have shown to be something they care about as it matters to them what their friends and family actually believe . it also matters to them that for all the acceptance of them , the catholic church still does not consider them able to get married . indeed , many might prefer the outright homophobia than that apparent hypocrisy of the catholic church . oh look , another strawman . what does it matter to my lgbt family or friends if the church doesn t consider them eligible for marriage ? they can get married outside of the church . my friend or family member doesn t have to be a christian to be my friend or family . my friend or family member doesn t have to agree with my beliefs to be my friend or family . . what matters to my friends and family is that im not prejudiced against them , nor do i think they have a mental illness that should be cured . you keep talking about 377a as if it s the only issue here , no it s not . you need to stop weaseling around the main point that you are spreading falsehoods about the catholic and the majority of the local protestant groups , because the issue isn t just 377a . it s also about the core teachings of the church and how it affects the daily relationships between lgbt people and church goers . to say that one group teaches love and acceptance and another teaches mental illness is a minor difference , on top of naming only the groups that teaches love and acceptance as anti lgbt out of seven protestant denominations while disregarding the group the teaches mental illness an obvious act of shit stirring . i don t ? for goodness sake for someone that complains over and over about lies and misinformation , you could do well to actually read what you are complaining over . i have clearly explained that while the churches have different approaches it s literally in my first post that the catholic church holds a less critical view , i regard the difference as minor . this is obviously different from the same view . so teaching love and accept lgbt people . don t discriminate , don t judge is a minor difference from homosexuality is a mental illness that should be cured . got it . i understand your stance clearly now . you re a shit stirrer , whether you want to admit it or not . and sorry , catholics are by no means the most supportive of lgbt people . i don t know where this idea is based from , but lgbt find much more support amongst secular support groups than the catholic church . even among religious groups , buddhists are far more accepting of lgbt people . just among christians , it is the free community church not catholic that actually supports lgbt people . come on , are you really that stupid ? is it not obvious enough that i m making the point within the confines of christianity ? let me put it simply for you then since you insist on playing dumb . amongst the christian groups , despite being passively supportive to 377a which is anti lgbt to a minor degree compared to actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns , catholics that teach love and accept lgbt people is the most supportive group compared to other groups that teach homosexuality is a mental illness and groups that actively hold anti lgbt campaigns . . is that better for you ? if you re going to talk about free community church then i m going to ask , why are you shifting the goal post to now include a church that isn t even on the national council of churches ? i literally mention protestants in my first post , which says that both the catholic church and the protestants are the main anti lgbt group . so why not just say christians ? the fact you separate the two groups show that you are not ignorant of the fact they have vastly different teachings regarding lgbt . and since you are not ignorant of that fact , why do you still sterotype them into having the same teaching and stance ? the catholic church is , as a matter of fact , anti lgbt , and you can t run away from that simply because some protestant churches are worse . i never said that they weren t . let me help you establish some facts . 1 the catholic church supports 377a . 2 most protestant groups support 377a . from these two facts , i ll give it to you that they are anti lgbt with regards only to 377a . 3 the catholic church teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people . 4 a certain denomination of the protestants group organizes the wear white campaign , an anti lgbt campaign . 5 a certain denomination of the protestants believe that homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured via conversion therapy . now , you yourself have admitted that there is a difference between the beliefs and teachings of the above mentioned groups . i m leaving out angelicans here for simplicity . however , you are still adamant in saying the difference is only minor , when clearly these teachings significantly affect the day to day relationships between lgbt people and church goers . 6 the person you are defending says that catholics and angelicans are the largest anti lgbt group . 7 the person you are defending clearly knows that he is singling out two specific groups , the catholic church , and the angelican church , which is only one out of at least seven local protestant denominations , and even excluded the non denominational churches by not categorizing the entire group as christians instead . given that the person knows very well there is a distinction between the groups , he still chose to single out group 3 , catholics , and the angelican church , and completely disregard groups 4 and 5 . tell me , what does this behavior look like to you ?

i recall a few years ago when moh hpb had an online infographic about trans lgbt health but it was sadly taken down because of pressure from some vocal parts of society .,"its a really well written article , and i hope that our society becomes more inclusive over time . i recall a few years ago when moh hpb had an online infographic about trans lgbt health but it was sadly taken down because of pressure from some vocal parts of society . so sometimes , we can t expect ministries or govt to take the lead , because there has been more than one time when ministries are progressive but get whacked by society . i do have one gripe about this article , which is this to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology . science does have a role in addressing some of these questions , but at the end of the day , morality and ethics has to answer the most important parts . and it s bad to shove it all to science and technocrats , because science doesn t have these answers . for example , there is a question as to whether should minors be allowed to go through permanent procedures . science can t answer such a question . science can tell us that gender dysphoria is a mental health condition , but science won t tell you that the best way to address this is by allowing procedures for minors . society has to determine what should be the limits of consent . and while a culture war fuelled by ignorance is bad , a debate about ethics and morality should be viewed as a good thing . it s part and parcel of a robust democracy to determine what our values should be .

"the decision to repeal section 377a s377a of singapore s penal code , the divisive law that criminalises sex between men , has been met by disappointment from the alliance of pentecostal and charismatic churches of singapore apccs .","the decision to repeal section 377a s377a of singapore s penal code , the divisive law that criminalises sex between men , has been met by disappointment from the alliance of pentecostal and charismatic churches of singapore apccs . prime minister lee hsien loong made the announcement to repeal the colonial era law during the national day rally 2022 ndr 2022 on sunday 21 august . singapore plans to amend its constitution to enshrine the definition of marriage and prevent the issue from being challenged in the courts , lee added . in a media statement released after ndr 2022 , apccs chairman reverend yang tuck yong said , the repeal is an extremely regrettable decision which will have a profound impact on the culture that our children and future generations of singaporeans will live in . however , we also recognise that the government seeks to bring about a balance among many differing viewpoints on this matter . we strongly urge the government to entrench the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman in the singapore constitution . that would be the most prudent way forward . should the matter be put to a parliamentary vote , the party whip should be lifted as part of due democratic process in multi religious singapore , apccs said , so that members of parliament can represent the voice of all people , including the religious , and vote according to the feedback they have received . the roman catholic archdiocese of singapore also responded to the repeal of s377a , saying , we do not seek to criminalise the lgbtq lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , for they too are children of god and loved by him . in a statement on its website , the church added , however , we seek protection of the family and marriage according to natural law and our rights to teach and practise them unhindered . we must not allow reverse discrimination to take place against those who believe in marriage as defined between a man and a woman . taking comfort in the government s plan to enshrine the definition of marriage in the constitution , it added , otherwise , we will be taking a slippery road of no return , weakening the fabric of a strong society which is founded on the bedrock of holistic families and marriages . the humanist society , which seeks to represent non religious people in singapore , said it celebrates the announcement to repeal s377a . s377a , a vestige of british colonial rule , criminalised sex between consenting male adults . it dehumanised individuals , infringed upon the most personal of liberties , and imposed a religious code on a secular public , it said in a statement . we note that while some individuals or organisations may have disagreed with the repeal , we hope that they will eventually come around to see that building a fairer , more inclusive , secular society benefits everyone , regardless of race , language , religion , or sexual orientation . with this repeal , we can look forward to a more progressive singapore society , based on justice and equality . pink dot sg , a support group for the lgbt community , said that while the repeal is a hard won victory , it comes as far too late for many due to past victims of s377a who had faced threats such as raids and criminal charges . it also expressed disappointment on the proposed constitution amendment to enshrine the definition of heterosexual marriage , urging the government not to heed recent calls from religious conservatives for such a move . such a decision will undermine the secular character of our constitution , codify further discrimination into supreme law , and tie the hands of future parliaments . the announcement to repeal s377a comes after years of contentious debates and legal challenges from various parties who either argue for and against the law . in 2007 , parliament amended the penal code but left s377a unchanged . s377a , which refers to sexual acts between men but not women and specifies the punishment for violation , reads , any male person who , in public or private , commits , or abets the commission of , or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of , any act of gross indecency with another male person , shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years . the government had maintained that while s377a is written in law , it would not be actively enforced in order to reach a messy compromise between the conservative majority who want to preserve the sanctity of marriage and family , and top legal professionals , civil activists , the lgbt community and others who have been pushing for its repeal . https sg . news . yahoo . com ndr 2022 churches section 377a

the 3rd group of gender rights activists are special .,"to consider such things , one must consider the motivation of activists fighting for equal rights in general . generally , activists fighting such causes can be grouped as follows 1 . personal stakes , 2 . popularity , and 3 . ideology . this probably is non exhaustive but i can t think of others right now . if you look at groups 1 and 2 , you will realise they rarely have any intention to care beyond the scope . of course some people who fight because they are personally involved have good reasons , such as sexual victims fighting for a space to voice out against masculinity . others fight because they are disadvantaged in their pursuits , for example , maybe some overly ambitious careerwomen . then you also have the sjw who only care about such causes because it makes them feel popular and important . they are all fighting for their own stakes and own benefit . they rarely have any interest to care about anything beyond . in general , these are the people who have a not my business mentality and the driving reason why they are involved in the first place is because it is their business . but beyond that narrow scope , it is no longer their business . also , given that none of these activists usually realise their goals , they will always feel that their fight is incomplete and they rarely see a reason to divert energy away from their goals . so , why would group 1 and 2 of gender rights activists care about truly equal gender equality ? group 1 cares mostly because they are at the pointy end of the stick , and they are fighting to get out of that end . to some , they don t even care who the pointy end points at next , as long as they aren t the ones . this often give rise to the paradoxical situation where the fight for equality is merely a fight to change the oppressors from one group to another , which in this case , if they succeed , they will be the new oppressors . group 2 gender rights activists fights simply because it is cool , popular . they have no ideology , nor do they have any serious personal stakes beyond popularity , importance and ego . given that the narrative against male rights , and nonsense narratives of how males are dominant regardless of reality emphasis on regardless of reality , it is unpopular for them to back or at least acknowledge such things as male equality . the 3rd group of gender rights activists are special . as ideological driven people , they are very committed and intense . but , whether they care about similar moral issues depends on their ideology . like how some people believe in really ridiculous and warped ideologies , such as racial supremacy or male chauvinism , there can exists a warped female version the female chauvinist . the female version , like the male one , believes their own gender as superior , and thus see no issue whatsoever with inequality . there is no hope at all to think they would even care . another kind of the 3rd group are logical ideologues , who believe in general gender equality . for some , they might not yet see or realise how men is disadvantaged sometimes emphasis on sometimes . these are one of the most hopeful of the bunch , as they are likely to eventually see the actual situation and not some narrative . for others , they know and they do understand , but they can t fight or were denied any spotlight because of prevailing societal narrative demonising or downplaying the problem . the problem today with social media is the danger of forming the wrong kind of narratives . once the narrative is formed , opposition are disregarded regardless of logic , and often being demonised as the opposite of what they want to be . the problem is , the narrative has already been formed . the narrative does not care about facts , it only cares about what panders to the masses . the female inequality , with them being the weak and vulnerable gender , generally does very well pandering to the emotions of the masses . so , why do no one stand up for male equality , despite it being a problem ? the answer is simple , either they do not care , or they can t stand up without being heckled . i dare say that some sjw are heckling you right now and probably have excuses about how men are so dominant that a little oppression couldn t hurt and only make them more equal . emphasis on the quotation marks . edit grammar",13-09-2020 12:38,Reddit,rights,1

"but many activists have made clear their intent to go beyond repeal and push for , among other things , same sex marriage and controversial sexuality education .","section 377a of the penal code , which criminalises acts of gross indecency between males in public or private , is one of the most controversial topics in singapore today . some consider the law to be outdated and discriminatory against people who identify as lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq , et cetera . others who favour retaining section 377a consider the law to be a critical symbol of singapore s mainstream values on marriage and family , as well as sexuality and gender . apart from law and policy , the debate also has implications on a wider question of social harmony how can people with vastly differing viewpoints coexist side by side in singapore society , without resulting in clashes or conflicts over deeply held values ? with these issues in mind , we consider what the best way forward is . since we started reading and writing about this matter , we have realised that children and youth are the most vulnerable in this great tussle of value systems . foreign news reports tell of young children being made to learn that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , that gender confusion an often conflicting and painful experience is not just normal , but should be celebrated and accompanied by irreversible treatment from a very young age . these practices may be harmful to children . for example , sweden has largely banned the use of puberty blockers to treat gender confused children , owing to harmful side effects , and the united states authorities have recently warned of side effects such as symptoms of brain swelling . children are also taught that mothers and fathers are completely interchangeable , and encouraged to be sexually experimental since all sexual behaviours are equal , despite the science showing that some behaviours are riskier than others . in singapore , we already have local examples of school going children encouraged to use gender pronouns in controversial ways and young teenagers identifying as pansexual and the alienating or bullying of those who disagree . marriage , family , children and societal values so what has repealing section 377a to do with this ? as the only law that retains a distinction between heterosexual and homosexual behaviours , its existence , on principle , restrains advancing lgbtq activism that contributes to a hyper sexualised environment and a disproportionate focus on sexual and gender identities . its non enforcement allows our fellow lgbtq citizens to engage in such sexual behaviours without government intervention . but many activists have made clear their intent to go beyond repeal and push for , among other things , same sex marriage and controversial sexuality education . however , to have fruitful and honest public debate on these other issues , it is crucial for those with contrary views to resist strong international pressure such as through diversity policies in global multinational corporations and the immense intimidation on social media . if section 377a is repealed , the ground will only become further divided and civil dialogue harder to achieve . activists have called the threat to family a myth , saying that the repeal will not cause a breakdown of marriage in terms of divorces . however , while existing individual marriages may not break down , marriage and family as social institutions with public importance will be affected . it is critical that social policy continues to prioritise the best interests of children , whenever possible . decades of social science show that the best conditions to raise a child are when the child grows up in a healthy family with both a biological father and mother , who are in a stable and lasting marriage . at the level of state wide policies , if the traditional family unit is weakened , society will be weakened as well , with implications for social policy , welfare spending and criminal justice . we know how important it is to give children good homes to thrive in , and to involve both fathers and mothers in their children s lives because each plays a unique and complementary role in the parenting of their children . thus , one of us founded dads for life to reduce the adverse impact of fatherlessness including physically or emotionally absent or abusive fathers on children . the other continued his work in designing and delivering highly customised marriage and family development programmes for families at various stages of their life cycles , including helping former convicts to reintegrate into their families and society , as well as being a chief juror for an annual exemplary fathers award , which has gone a long way to inspire fathers in the community . on the other hand , in a same sex household , a child loses a connection with either a father or a mother . given that half of a child s dna comes from the father , and the other half comes from the mother , to say that two fathers or two mothers make no difference to the child is to put adults desires before the needs and rights of the child . this is on top of the ethical difficulties surrounding the ways in which same sex couples obtain children such as surrogacy , which objectifies children , and women who are surrogates . if there is no proper consideration of all these possible negative effects of same sex marriages and family , we put children at risk by entering uncharted territory at the level of public policy . the existing status quo on section 377a is based on a careful balance and a political compromise adopted by parliament in 2007 following an extensive debate . this political package to use the words of our apex court already achieves a precious and well thought out balance . it ensures that the norms and values on marriage and family will remain mainstream , while giving space for lgbtq people to live freely and contribute to society . best way forward seeing how the repeal of section 377a can have a far wider and deeper impact on our policies relating to family and children than we realise , what is the best way forward ? who should we be most concerned about ? the repeal of section 377a does not just affect the definition of marriage , but also has repercussions on the well being of children . therefore , children should be the first priority . and we believe the majority will agree . since children develop best in a stable family with their married biological parents , we should try our very best to promote and protect such a family structure . we recognise that society is imperfect and families are imperfect , but that does not mean we should not strive towards the ideal in public policies , while offering support to others who already find themselves in imperfect conditions . we must do everything we can to protect our children , and we strongly recommend the following enshrine man woman marriage in our constitution , to show how we cherish the time tested value of the natural family unit as a nation , and to protect against any attempt to redefine it . having it enshrined in the constitution the highest law of the land will ensure that it is protected for the long term , it can be amended only by a two thirds majority of parliament , and man woman marriage has the highest priority in law and policy . enshrining man woman marriage in our constitution is insufficient to protect children from being indoctrinated with controversial and age inappropriate ideas and beliefs on sexuality . to better protect children , we must enact new legislation . this ensures that all other related policies , for example , guidelines on media codes and sex education in schools , can take reference from this new legislation the way it is being done now , with section 377a maintaining the distinction between homosexual and heterosexual relations . alternatively , the same effect can be achieved by keeping section 377a , given that the provision has already been vigorously debated in parliament , with the stance taken that it would not be proactively enforced . if section 377a is to be amended at all , a possible amendment might be to remove the words in private . if this is done , traditional marriage and legislation relating to children must be in place . it must also be made clear that the section is retained in the amended form as an important signal as to the norm of heterosexual relations . we would like to stress that this is not about discriminating against those who identify as lgbtq . we further denounce any threats of harm to those in the community . disagreeing with certain ideas is not discrimination . the debate over section 377a is about much more than the repeal of a provision that is not being proactively enforced . more importantly , it concerns the well being of our children and our nation . it would be very unwise for the government to repeal section 377a until and unless there are robust safeguards in place , especially for the sake of our children . singapore is at a unique juncture in time , at which it can chart its own course that avoids the polarisation over lgbtq issues that has divided many societies in the west , maintain the commitment to family values that have helped singapore to thrive , and allow space for different groups to contribute to society . the current precious and careful balance has served singapore well , and we should decide wisely as we consider the best way forward on section 377a . jason wong is a former senior civil servant , and the founder of the yellow ribbon project and the dads for life movement . mohd khair is a local and regional trainer and consultant who has helped many parents , youth and families through designing , developing and delivering highly interactive training programmes for more than two decades . both organised the recent protect singapore townhall event to discuss the impact of repealing section 377a of the penal code . the views expressed here are in their personal capacity .

"calling this issue as a a matter of political correctness , fails to account for the substantive effect of 377a ."," true we are not single issue voters , but you want to appeal as much as possible to broader audiences . i think this goes back to my earlier point about the reserved presidency , casinos , and even the fake news bill as it was passed . these matters faced wide spread and broad lack of popularity , far more than the worst case scenario of every single christian and catholic being a single issue voter who would vote out the government for voting in 377a . the fact that despite this , we still have casinos , the current president , and the fake news bill , suggests to me that the pap well knows that singaporeans are not single issue voters . consequently the entire political necessity argument stands on shaky legs . history has shown that singaporeans are willing to stomach deeply unpopular issues so long as the government overall is seen to be doing good . unless something drastically changes , the stance for political correctness seems to be not addressing the elephant in the room . which is why in my first post above i mentioned that if we do become a more secular nation , repealing 377a would be the main talking point to appear more progressive . i find the use of political correctness here rather curious , because if you accept that the existence of 377a is not a morally neutral position , and that gay men lack the same ability to legally have anal intercourse , then it follows that 377a is an issue that goes well beyond the window dress of political correctness . it has substantive impact of gay men in singapore a point directly acknowledged by the court of appeal . calling this issue as a a matter of political correctness , fails to account for the substantive effect of 377a . haha i like to think that the imagine part of the sentence whoever compasses , imagines , invents , devises , or intends the death is just legal trying to cover all bases , however silly it may seem in foresight . the word imagine is only used in this manner in relation to the president , and not other crime . it s there intentionally , and not simply legally trying to cover all bases . it literally creates a thought crime . my point in referring to s121a is to draw a direct contrast to crimes that truly are unenforceable . 377a is currently enforced simply because the present government and ag says so . these positions can change in the future , and unlike the thought crime of s121a , there is no technical or theoretical problems with enforcing 377a . it has been enforced in the past , and if the government changes its mind , it can be enforced in the future . the very question i ask myself when they banned a certain band from performing in singapore . the thing about political landscapes is that organised entities always have more negotiating power . they can collectively drop support for a single politician , because they stand together . again , i find this reasoning suspect . in order for this to be a substantive worry , these are the things that would have to happen i christians and catholics vote as a united bloc ii christians and catholics are all single issue voters on and that issue is the repeal of 377a iii christians and catholics are equally distributed across all grcs in the country for maximum effect and iv christians and catholics are willing to vote for the other party , solely based on this single issue . my view is that the more likely scenario is that our government is not as secular as it professes , and that within the government , there is an over representation of christians who are unable to separate their personal religious view on lgbt issues , and the question of whether as a secular nation such matters should be in the law . this explanation is far more likely than the phantom fear of the existence of a large single issue christian voting bloc .

"i hold no love for his pov , what surprised me is that he said he has same sex attraction and shared a bit about his time while he was active in the gay community .","unfortunately i went to watch the whole thing because i wanted to hear them out before commenting . i ll just summarise my observations and give some thoughts . the reporter and the dialogue centre director generally said thing that were more to the side of empathy towards the lgbtq a . k . a queers , i want to use this word instead because it s easier and can represent true community . the reporter didn t say much , and the director mostly shared stories about folks from the queer community . he also shared about how there needs to be civil dialogue , and this point about having dialogue is something that generally everyone in the panel agreed with . he didn t introduce this point btw . most of the sharing came from the pink dot pd rep . he shared experiences about queer folks , highlighted about how everyone should be able to express themselves , have civil discussions and etc . i m feel that he did alright pertaining to the issues discussed , in general . the 3 16 rep was mostly concerned about cancel culture , spoke about how his church helped to equip parents to handle when their children come out , and shared experiences about discrimination from one person who was called a homophobe and was bullied and he claims that person is not actually a homophobe . i hold no love for his pov , what surprised me is that he said he has same sex attraction and shared a bit about his time while he was active in the gay community . the first topic was about today s poll about 377a repeal and same sex marriage is it wrong , and is it important to define it as man and woman . pd rep says it s an opportunity to talk to these people and educate them , while 3 16 says that these respondents likely did their homework and came to the conclusion that marriage s definition as man and woman should stay , citing the if you allow gay marriage , then what s next ? ? ? type of fear mongering . there s a lot that could have been discussed and i think this debate could have taken up the entire hour , but in general i don t like the 3 16 s assumption that all respondents have researched opinions . i would hypothesise that they actually just answered in a way that supports the government s reasoning government says we are repealing 377a but keeping marriage s definition as m f . therefore 377a is bad . uphold definition of marriage as m f is good . we live in a effectively one party state , and i would say that the trickle down of opinions on social matters from the government could be the reason for this . if you disagree with my hypothesis , that s valid . unfortunately the today survey didn t ask why people responded this way . it just noted that religious people were more likely to support 377a s stay , and support the definition of marriage as m f . btw the 3 16 guy said that saying the framing of these statistics shouldn t be confined to religion . this is something that is contradicted by the reporter s article . the article highlights that religious people are the ones who are more opposed to 377a and prefer m f marriage definition . but the reporter mostly just nods as if she doesn t want to say that she highlighted that religious people were more opposed in her article . like , why else would the reporter highlight that religious people were more opposed if it religion isn t a main factor ? anyways then they discussed about the safety of queer folks in sg . generally the director and pd rep said that there s a lot of emotional and psychological damage , and not so much of physical although there is some in the form of getting kicked out of the house for example . 3 16 guy s response was that there are were cases of people having different ideas about queerness who were discriminated . he said i had one guy who was accused of being homophobic despite not being homophobic , and he was bullied . he also had one other example relating to work but it s similar in nature to his point . i mostly agree with the director and pd rep . 3 16 rep was basically pulling the old i m actually the victim card . christians and muslim make up like more than 30 of the population 2020 singstat , while queer people only make up like 12 2022 ipsos as i ve mentioned it s usually religious people who are highlighted as the opposition to queer rights , so i feel that he is wrong to try and play the victim here . the predominant culture has been to suppress queers . this guy even talked about the police raids on gay scenes many years ago . this 12 is the weaker community , whilst the 30 have the numbers and a long standing culture of heteronormativity in the country . is bullying anti queer people wrong ? arguably yes , but it s likely much less of an issue than queer bullying . there was a lengthy session about cancel culture , basically everyone say cancelling is wrong and we should talk things out . i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against . like dude , you learnt to suppress your true sexual self . i would feel bad for you if you weren t part of a church that works to convert people into abstinence from their same sex attractions . also , the issue is not about attraction . who you are attracted to could largely be kept secret . it is hard to discriminate by who youre attracted to . it is , however , easy to discriminate against people who act on those attractions because they are engaging in a physical act that can be caught seen by other people . don t equivocate attraction with the issue being discussed , which is about expressing thoughts and ideas . it s not the same topic and isn t relevant . another thought is that i wish that the pd rep talked about how cancel culture is something that is not just done by the left , it s also done by the right . if i come out to my conservative christian extended family , they aren t going to just agree to disagree they ll call me a sinner and likely ask me to go for conversion therapy or repent . that is cancel culture too . i expressed my thoughts and got shamed , and was silenced and asked to reform . tbc edit some spelling and grammar fixes . lack of brainpower to fix everything",16-11-2022 23:12,Reddit,same sex,1

people who make efforts to prevent homosexual relations whatever that means ?,"the law does govern private relations when it comes to sex . 377a would be unenforceable pragmatically unless you get caught doing it in public , which would have been a crime regardless of orientation . how do you prevent something that happens between people in private ? people who make efforts to prevent homosexual relations whatever that means ? doing so without the law only show that the law itself is pointless no one uses it or can realistically use it . what is left is the threat of someone using it , or even reforms to strengthen it , as well as the symbolism and meaning of the provision to denigrate lgbt folk as second class citizens . as long as the law exists , lgbt folk will not be able to be fully accepted as part of society . i find that there are already plenty of laws that run against homosexuals , such as the fact that they cannot marry . they already face discrimination as is why add to it ? this is why i don t agree that the law is a good middle stance just because there isn t outright prosecution or arrest for homosexuals , etc doesn t mean the law is somehow a compromise between the two parties . as long as the law remains , society will unlikely be able to progress to become a more empathetic , encompassing one . but the reason the repeal debate has revived is because the government is planning to reform the penal code this month . this is the best chance for any reform of 377a outside of political goodwill direct parliamentary intervention . this is all my opinion , in any case , and i have nothing against you personally , just voicing my thoughts on a public forum .

"we just need to spell it out formally rather than casting it as common sense , because only then can we safely remove the christian doctrine and hence , laws against homosexuality completely from the law without exposing it to arguments that seek to repeal other laws currently upheld by that doctrine ."," . . . legalized homosexuality was the doorway to legalized bestiality and pedophilia we begin by legalizing homosexuality . in doing so we reject the basis on which the law was created likely due to christian doctrine , traces back to our british colonial history . christian doctrine ceases to be a legitimate basis in the upholding of certain other laws actually on most counts , it probably already has . in the absence of other backing arguments , these laws are in fact open to debate . new reasoning is required if we are to uphold these other laws . they could be from concepts of morality from other religions or based in science , but the point is that new consensus has to be reached , and with it comes a discussion not unlike the one we re having right now . what really is the basis on which we uphold our laws ? x200b hypothetically this new consensus could be formed upon a moral framework not unlike the one you suggested , which seeks to uphold human rights as long as they don t infringe on others . a minority group of people who practice bestiality can then make the argument that they don t infringe on anyone s freedom . following which , our initial rejection of the christian doctrine and legalizing of homosexuality has led to the legalizing of bestiality . pedophilia probably doesn t work out under this framework , but a different consensus albeit a more absurd one could lead to its legalization as well . x200b i don t mean to imply that homosexuals and people who practice bestiality are the same class of people , and this hypothetical scenario is really just that hypothetical but where legalization is concerned , op s argument that legalizing homosexuality can eventually lead to legalized bestiality , is not entirely without merit . x200b that said , the reason why most people wouldn t think this hypothetical scenario is likely is probably because there is already a general consensus that exists which separates the homosexuals from these other classes of people . we just need to spell it out formally rather than casting it as common sense , because only then can we safely remove the christian doctrine and hence , laws against homosexuality completely from the law without exposing it to arguments that seek to repeal other laws currently upheld by that doctrine . this is the framework i seek .

lai s mother said that on may 4 , at about 7am , hsia had gone to lai s home and allegedly told the victim he would teach him how to handle real estate matters . he had also supposedly asked lai to bring along identification documents . hsia then took lai back to his home before bringing the victim to the marriage registration centre . investigations further revealed that as the registration for marriage requires the consent of two external parties , hsia took lai to search for two people . both of the people that hsia subsequently found were reported to be young men in their 20s , at a nearby supermarket and just outside the centre . hsia reportedly obtained their signatures by asking both men if they supported same sex marriage and taking out the form for them to sign . hsia and lai then returned to hsia s residence at about 9am . lai was subsequently found dead outside the apartment building at 11am . taiwanese media initially reported that lai had fallen from the 10th floor to his death . family hired forensic doctor victim unlikely to have fallen to his death following the incident , lai s body was subjected to an autopsy by the taichung district prosecutor s office before being returned to the family . the family then commissioned another forensic doctor , kao ta cheng , to examine lai s body and the location of where his body was found . kao was subsequently quoted as saying that it was unlikely for lai to have died by falling from the 10th storey . he noted that the injuries lai had sustained were too light , with only a fractured right elbow and no haemorrhages in his head and abdominal cavities . kao suggested that lai was likely to have been poisoned instead and might have vomited shortly before his death , as indicated by the patch of dead grass where his body was found . responding to media queries , the district prosecutor s office for taichung added that its autopsy report on lai s death was still pending but it respected the relevant actions and remarks of the family and related personnel outside the legal proceedings . the office also reiterated that evidence of the crime must still undergo rigorous legal procedures and called for relevant parties not to infer the circumstances of the crime from conjecture and to let the judiciary do its job . suspect out on bail at s 13 , 100 in the meantime , hsia is reportedly out on bail at ntd300 , 000 s 13 , 100 . hsia and his father were reportedly subjected to a five hour long interrogation on may 22 by taichung s authorities . they did not respond to media questions when they left afterwards . in response to taiwanese media queries about the incident , hsia s father said he did not know anything . the victim s family has called for the prosecution to apply for hsia to be taken into custody to prevent him from fleeing . meanwhile , one of taichung s city councilors the equivalent of a member of parliament at the city level in taiwan , huang jian hao , has called for hsia to prove he had no motive in murdering lan by voluntarily renouncing his inheritance rights to lai s property . top screenshots via cts news youtube",21-05-2023,Hardware Zone,rights,0
"again , things like marriage are not rights protected under the constitution .","i can understand your point but it also strays far away from the argument of 377a . you state that there is a tangible negative effect . this doesn t make sense because even if you repeal it , those that are against the lgbt community are not suddenly going to be more accepting of it as even from op s perspective , it is clear that those that are against lgbt lifestyle aren t doing so because the government tells them to but because of their own backgrounds and understandings . when you mention civil liberties , we can assume things like marriage and not being prosecuted but as many have already said , it is not a law that is enforced and there is no evidence that suggests that once 377a is repealed , new laws will be added to give similar rights to lgbt folk that heterosexual people have which is why people say 377a is symbolic in the first place . but ignoring that , what is your definition of civil liberties ? what exactly are they being denied under the constitution ? again , things like marriage are not rights protected under the constitution . if you mention things like protection from hate speech then you should also understand that by definition they are technically still given that liberty . you can read what rights are protected and what exceptions there are here https sso . agc . gov . sg act cons1963 ? provids pr9 , pr10 , pr11 , pr12 , pr13 , pr14 , pr15 . the government has no responsibility to protect the lgbt community from religious individuals as they have every right to speak out as it is part of their doctrine not to accept homosexual acts just as how pro lgbt individuals are free to criticise their opinions . the idea that we should protect all minorities while good natured is impossible . we see this in eu countries that either have strong opposition towards letting in refugees , have opposition groups against pro refugee policies or have policies to better help transition of refugees due to the difference in cultures . similarly , the lgbt lifestyle runs against the lifestyle of the majority and thus , it is fair to have opposition against it . now , you might say that there is nothing wrong with the lgbt lifestyle but that isn t the point . tl dr under the constitution , they have the same rights and as mentioned before , 377a isn t enforced .

"following the court of appeal s ruling in february on section 377a , home affairs and law minister k .","what did the attorney general say in response to these calls ? following the comments by mr woon and mr rajah , attorney general lucien wong said in 2018 that the public prosecutor retains independence in deciding whether to pursue a case under section 377a . the police , when conducting investigations into an offence under the law , will decide whether or not there is sufficient basis to refer the case to the public prosecutor . the public prosecutor will then determine whether to charge an offender under the law , and in doing so exercises his independent discretion solely on the basis of his assessment of the facts , the law and the public interest . while the pp public prosecutor is entitled to consider public policies in exercising his discretion , these do not fetter the exercise of prosecutorial discretion , he had said . the public prosecutor s exercise of prosecutorial discretion has always been , and remains , unfettered . in the case of section 377a , where the conduct in question was between two consenting adults in a private place , the public prosecutor had , absent other factors , taken the position that prosecution would not be in the public interest . this remains the position today . how did the apex court rule on the most recent challenge ? in february , the court of appeal , led by the chief justice , held that section 377a is completely unenforceable in its entirety , meaning that while the law will stay on the books , it cannot be used to prosecute men for having sex with other men . legal scholars and the gay community lauded the decision for giving gay men real protection from prosecution under the law . the apex court said that the attorney general s comments in 2018 , when he said the public prosecutor would not prosecute two consenting men for having sex in private , had given legal significance to the political compromise struck in 2007 when pm lee said the law would not be proactively enforced . mr wong s representations had also given people a legitimate expectation of not being prosecuted under section 377a , based on the administrative law doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations , the court said . as such , section 377a would remain unenforceable unless and until the attorney general of the day revokes the 2018 representations . given this , the three men who challenged the law dr tan , mr ong and mr choong do not currently face any real and credible threat of prosecution . they thus do not have the legal standing to mount constitutional challenges against the law , the court said , dismissing their bid . the ruling could also mean that other gay men will not have the standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 377a , unless and until the attorney general s stance changes . how did the government respond to the latest court ruling ? following the court of appeal s ruling in february on section 377a , home affairs and law minister k . shanmugam said the government is carefully considering the best way forward on the law . he also reiterated the government s stance on the law , noting pm lee had said in 2007 that singaporeans want a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society . but mr shanmugam , who made the remarks in parliament when responding to questions from mps on the ruling , had also said that public policies need to evolve to keep abreast of changes in views in society , and legislation will also have to evolve to support updated policies . he said that if the government decides to move on the law , it will do so in a way that continues to balance these different viewpoints , and avoids causing a sudden , destabilising change in social norms and public expectations . shortly after , the government started its review of the law , consulting widely , including religious and lgbt groups . https www . straitstimes . com singap . . . gn stfb utm medium social utm source facebook",21-08-2022,Hardware Zone,377a,0

non trans athletes have a hard enough time getting their parent s support .,"i m a trans man , and transitioned back in 2011 . i m in touch with many other trans people in singapore . we re already here in society . we have families , we re a part of schools and workplaces , churches and mosques and temples . we use public toilets . we have mutual friends with jason wong . so the thing is while many people fear what will happen when trans people become part of society , trans people are already part of society . this also means some reframing is needed , because trans people are not a distinct group of strangers but people you may already know and interact with regularly without knowing . some may be your family who haven t come out yet , some may be friends or colleagues you don t know are trans , or the barista who makes your coffee , or the grab driver who cannot find your place , or the insurance agent who keeps calling you , or the old aunties chatting in the void deck . a common mistake seems to be assuming that accepting trans people means becoming like the most vocally aggressive of americans . but the reasons we re not like that have little to do with lgbtq rights and everything to do with singaporeans being an especially obedient population that s terrified of the government , for better or worse . ironically , it s the constant anti lgbtq content that is what is causing more of the community to step up into activism . when lgbtq people are being kicked out of homes , abused , insulted by teachers , sent for conversion therapy , denied the jobs we need to survive , banned from the healthcare we need to live , barred from starting families with the people we love , it makes it difficult to just stay quiet and instead call for changes that will ensure our safety , dignity and equality . do we accept feelings over science regarding trans people in sports ? science and social research . but this is also very much a western issue . it s like their debate over whether trans people should be allowed in the military over here , most trans women are trying to get out of the military rather than into it . the same applies to sports , because singapore is not a country that values sports the way they do in the west parents are much more concerned about exams . non trans athletes have a hard enough time getting their parent s support . trans girls in particular are also much less likely to enjoy sports because it s framed as such a masculine endeavour . already in the west , there are so few trans athletes that the small handful end up all over the news . our population is only a tiny fraction of theirs . it would be unlikely enough to even have one . it s also why it makes no sense to look to the west to anticipate problems , because any challenges if any that arise from integrating trans people into singapore society are going to be uniquely singaporean . when is the right time for hrt ? should we encourage hrt ? it s a medical treatment , so it s like asking if we should encourage people to take panadol if they have a fever . some trans people have body dysphoria that can only be resolved with hrt , and thus should be allowed to access it . other trans people are comfortable with their bodies but feel pressured into hrt to be taken seriously as their gender , and while in an ideal world they wouldn t feel that pressure , we don t live in that world yet . regardless , hrt has also been available in singapore for decades , and trans people have been on it for just as long . these are not new questions or issues , and more people simply being aware of them will not in itself change society .

2nd part some may argue that the very existence of 377a legalizes discrimination and constitutes of institutional discrimination towards lgbt in singapore .,"2nd part some may argue that the very existence of 377a legalizes discrimination and constitutes of institutional discrimination towards lgbt in singapore . note , 377a applies only to gays and not lesbians , and definitely not transgenders . so your point is , there is institutional discrimination to only gays , but not lesbians transgenders ? section 292 criminalizes the procession of pornographic materials , but as it is also rarely enforced , does it constitute of institutional discrimination of people who watch and download porn ? will i be fired from work , kicked out of house because the government legalized institutional discrimination towards people who love porn ? no ? same for 377a . so you don t care cause it technically doesn t affect you since i assume you are a post op transgender ? ok but other people do care that gay man can be charged for having sex with consent . liberals and activists love to claim gay discrimination in singapore . in an interview with buro 247 , writer and activist yi sheng ng claims , as a community that faces discrimination , where if our identities are known we face the risk of being bullied at school , abused in our families , and fired from work , we can t just sit back and wait for society to become nice . really ? the community faces discrimination ? doxxed ? bullied in school ? abused at homes and fired from work ? which third world part of singapore do you live in ? let me know , i ll investigate personally . eh there are so many cases and anecdotes of lgbtqs being bullied in school , kick out from their house , shun from the community , especially a religious one . there is even a shelter for homeless transgender who are kicked out and hotlines and counseling services for lgbtqs . yes , discrimination towards the lgbt exists , it exists in individualized employers , traditional families and social and religious groups . however there is barely any institutional homophobia nor discrimination towards gays in singapore . come on gays , let s not just make it all about you . yes , racial , age and religious discrimination exists , and the ministry of manpower and the tripartite alliance for fair and progressive employment practices tafep have their relevant legislation and guidelines on handling discrimination , and to ensure hiring practices that are fair and based on meritocracy and non discriminatory practices . facing discrimination at your workplace ?

where is the action to translate into a concrete action for the collective wishes of the lgbt community , ie , repell 377a and to legalize gay marriage ? what next for the lgbt individuals in singapore ? nothing changes . the government allocated hong lim park as a speaker s corner for singaporeans to gather and to host events the only designated spot in singapore . as the government knows , singaporeans need an outlet to vent off steam , just as much the pubescent 13 year old teen sneaks his elder brother s porn stash into his room to vent every once in a while . and that s exactly what pink dot is doing an annual venting of steam . 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 worth of community donations every year ? yup , they go to av sound systems , equipment rental , apparels and decorations , so that you can make it a grand party to get together and rah rah . so at the end of it , where do the funds go ? how about any towards at risk groups for the lgbt community ? and when the last confetti is tossed and the last pink champagne popped , what happens next for the lgbt community ? nothing . it s like an sg50 party year after year after year . fair enough if you don t feel that it helps , although some may argue that the fact that it has become popular means that the government has taken note of it and have to be more wary when reviewing such laws . it may take some time , but it is entirely possible they might with enough public pressure . it also shows lgbtqs that hey people in singapore do care about you and do want to ensure that you have equal rights as other singaporeans . also , it fun to piss off the waapd crazies . want to help the plight of the lgbt community in singapore ? put your money to real causes to help the marginalized lgbt individuals . there are much more worthy causes in singapore , see project t , a shelter for homeless transgenders in singapore oogachaga , a counseling and personal development agency for lgbt individuals . pink dot ? nope . oh wait , didn t you say that discrimination against lgbtq wasn t that serious , so why have such organizations ? oh btw , i believe oogacha sp is a sponsor and pink dot does highlight what they do to the public . finally , there s nothing proud to be gay just like there s nothing proud about being straight . if you are gay , you are just as normal as the next straight guy , why do you need a event to celebrate being gay ? how about let s make july hetrosexual pride month ? no ? i personally do not need pink dot nor a gay pride parade because i live with pride everyday of my life and surround myself with friends and loved ones . i am proud of my career achievements , my life experiences , and not because of my identity . i don t need an annual virtue signalling parade to make me feel good about who i am . the fact is , i am a singaporean first , and a transgender second . i would rather be celebrated for the former than for being different as the latter . pink dot this year ? nope , i wasn t even sipping a pink margarita , not even close . ok good for you . in any case , it does seem you acknowledge that discrimination exist in singapore but you feel that pink dot doesn t do enough , you want real action . it also feels to me that you are either sick and tired of gay men and ladies being the centre of attention and how people are not focusing on transgender people like you . that pink dot is only for the gays who are better off than transgender . you will only support something that directly and only benefits you . i don t know , sounds quite selfish and self centered to me because pink dot and the movement around yes does help gays , lesbians , queers and transgender people or just people who have issues about their sexuality .

the fact is op asked the question why does a man need to look at another man when he has the same body parts and the second commenter replied homosexual offences has been around since forever .," have you never heard of funding bias ? in my opinion john jay university is neutral , but if it were to be biased it is more likely to be biased towards the catholic church thanks to funding bias . i am not able to prove that people in the john jay university survey are not anti christians , but another similar survey done by actual catholics also published a 4 number https www . nytimes . com 2004 02 27 us two studies cite child sex abuse by 4 of priests . html so i am not anti christian for using 4 . i ve heard of funding bias but you re going to have to provide evidence that the people who conducted the survey and published the reports were biased . until you do , there is no way to prove that the numbers weren t exaggerated . now you are introducing the straw man of so i am not anti christian for using 4 . , the reason was that you associated 4 with the worldwide premise i set up , key points being the misrepresentation of in the us as being worldwide . the fact that you re introducing a new article not previously discussed or referenced to talk about something that arose from different articles shows just how desperate you are in your attempts to weasel . a quote from the new article you linked even proves my point that the church scandals have nothing to do with homosexuality but the john jay researchers differed , saying in an interview that they have no data on sexual orientation of the perpetrators and that the more likely explanation is that sexual abuse is a crime of opportunity and priests had more unfettered access to teenage boys than to teenage girls . you claim that i am misleading because i did not include the united states . fair point , and i will go edit my comment to include it now . but do you not think that you are not more misleading for using the number 4392 to claim that the percentage of sexual assaults is 1 , when the original survey that published the 4392 number stated that the percentage is 4 ? no i do not . i have nothing to edit and nothing to hide . i took the higher of the two definite numbers i could find , and considered that number as part of the worldwide statistic . the us is within the world , right ? there are no other definite numbers to use , no official studies or reports i can point to to base any other number upon . i even said at least 4392 to be as honest as possible . i don t give a damn what reason pope francis asked him to stay for . that is not important . proves my point , you ignore the reason in order to mislead the reader . i think it is better for him to deal with the situation that happened under his watch than to get away from it scott free . or are you saying he shouldn t be held accountable for the incidents that happened under his watch ? regarding the oakland diocese , the reason why i said the covering up is still occurring is because the oakland diocese priests have still yet to be reprimanded in any way by the diocese . if they were serious about being sorry for covering up sexual abuse cases , then they should have released a public post saying we are aware of the cases against the two oakland diocese priests . we have reprimanded them , and from now onwards , they will not be allowed to continue staying mass . wow , that s a huge leap of logic . how does yet to reprimand equate to covering up ? could you please explain this in detail ? failure to address the issue adequately is a far cry from attempting to cover up anything . furthermore , are you seriously suggesting that the church should have reprimanded the priest due to an uninvestigated allegation ? i ve already addressed why they were still allowed to stay for mass , so i m not sure why you re asking a question i ve already answered . since you missed it , here s what i said as we have seen from a previous article https en . m . wikipedia . org wiki priest shortage in the catholic church text shortage 20by 20area , worldwide , to 201 . 229 20billion 20in 202012 . i ve linked , there is a shortage of catholic priests worldwide , a problem that would only be made worse if any and every allegation caused the removal of a priest . from the john jay report in the us , only 5 . 7 of the accused were found guilty . in addition to the fact that people like you , and the person you are defending , who continually attack the catholic church op s post and question has nothing to do with the church , it isn t surprising that many false allegations exists . also lol at the why would a man need to look at another man ? thing . did you know why i put that fake comment into my post ? because i wanted to see if you even read the original post to begin with . lol are you seriously going to play the i didn t make a mistake , i was just testing you card ? please , this isn t a primary school discussion , put your childish and honestly pathetic attempt to redeem yourself away . you didn t even put that fake comment into your post . it was a question asked by the initial poster , which was mentioned in my post that you replied to . you didn t make the statement , you merely responded to it on two seperate posts , filthy liar . also , are you seriously claiming credit for being dishonest after the whole sjw and innocent act you put up about how you have nothing against the church ? you just fell for my trap and proved that you didn t even know what the original comment was talking about , you just saw catholic church in the second commenters post and began attacking . thank you for admitting that you are here not to engage in an honest discussion , but rather employ traps meant to mislead . let the record show this is just how pathetic and cunning anti christians weasels are , and the type of cunning tactics they will employ in order to tarnish the reputation of the church . you re starting to show your true colors now and you re proving my point perfectly . to address your part ii comments , you re very right that back then is subjective ! so , to the second commenter , back then happened to be 30 years ago , so he mentioned a case that happened 30 years ago , possibly because he couldn t think of any other cases that happened 30 years ago . nothing wrong with that right ? exactly , so since it is subjective why did you paint a picture that it was an objective fact that he was referring to events 20 30 years back ? unless you have definite objective proof that was the time period he was referring to , the entire point you made in regards to back then is completely invalid . congratulations , you just played yourself . also regarding your point about pedophiles who abuse children on the same gender of them not necessarily being homosexual , yes you are very right . but in this case the offender isn t necessarily also a homosexual , is he ? when i used the word homosexual , i meant sexual behaviour between members of the same gender , which is one of the definitions listed by wikipedia . in both cases priests and this article , there was indeed a homosexual act being performed . so again , therein lies the similarity in both cases , homosexual acts were performed . one massive strawman and red herring here . it is irrelevant if the offender was homosexual or not . the fact is op asked the question why does a man need to look at another man when he has the same body parts and the second commenter replied homosexual offences has been around since forever . whether or not the offender was indeed homosexual or not has no bearing whatsoever on the question , or the answer . let the record show that you ve chosen to double down on defending an anti lgbt lie , and perpetuate the falsehood that homosexuality is associated with pedophilia . you re disgusting . pretending to speak up for victims of abuse while simultaneously associating homosexuality with pedophilia . so i think your points about not referring to priests as homosexuals noun are irrelevant , since we re talking about the use of the word homosexual as a adjective to describe a certain type of behaviour . you can weasel around the definition all you want , but let s look at the facts . from the article the holy see stated that the majority of catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under 18 year olds should not be viewed as pedophiles , but as homosexuals . anyone with half a brain can see that the word homosexuals here is a noun . more importantly , let s look at exactly what we are discussing , which is this statement homosexual sex offenders have been around forever , just look at the catholic church . the world homosexual in this case is obviously used as to describe the orientation of the sex offender . if the statement was homosexual sex offences have been happening . . that would then be an adjective describing the nature of the offences , so cut the bullshit about it being an adjective and get your facts right . your weaseling is seriously pathetic . you have chosen to double down on defending an anti lgbt lie and perpetuate the idea that pedophiles are associated with homosexuals . a truly disgusting and downright abhorrent thing to do . it s 2021 and yet people like you still exist . what a two faced piece of shit , saying what about listening to victims of abuse while simultaneously associating the maginalized lgbt group with pedophilia . i believe he is perfectly justified in doing so as he was merely bringing up a valid example to show that non consensual homosexual acts have been around since a long time ago . to sum up , my points remain the same . the catholic church has a pedophile problem , not a homosexual one . and the response there s always been homosexual sex offenders has nothing to do with the question why would a man need to look at another man when he has the same body parts . however , at this point i d like to add another point you are a disgusting person for associating pedophilia with homosexuality .

i m unsure . this study https www . medrxiv . org content 10 . 1101 2020 . 12 . 01 . 20241653v1 . full . pdf had 1 44 and references two other studies that had 2 57 and 5 137 who started pb but did not go on to csh . afaik all who started on csh continued . wouldn t you agree that current standards set by doctors really don t mean anything because this field and issue is so unprecedented . no , even without familiarity with trans topics , having a theoretical basis wrt developmental psychology , endocrinology etc . is important background knowledge . also , christine jorgensen had the first successful reassignment surgery in 1952 , wpath has worked with trans people since the 1980s , pbs were used for precocious puberty since the 80s , and the dutch protocol since 2000s , with the first cohort in their 20 30s . i know that won t be enough for some but i think that s enough data to make some reasonable guidelines . for every pediatrician who believes in puberty blockers at a young age , i can find an equal number who believe that it is only right to wait till a much older age of say , 18 . okay , the american academy of pediatrics wrote this guide https pediatrics . aappublications . org content 142 4 e20182162 with a membership of 67 000 . can you find me , say , 6700 doctors who disagree with it ? even better if they came from the aap itself . this paper , where points 1 9 outlines the risks of adminstering puberty blockers . . . ok , so of the two articles for point one , one is in german and the other https sci hub . do https www . sciencedirect . com science article abs pii s1056499311000745 supports the dutch protocol . afaik they support point one by saying this worry exists , not this worry is justified . with respect to puberty , your choices are to a . continue endogenous puberty , b . go on cross sex hormones csh or c . take puberty blockers and make that a b choice later . given that c can lead to a or b , but a and b lead to changes that make c irrelevant , i m not sure what the argument is that kids are free and mature to do a which we do all the time but not c . personally , i don t think being mature or authentically free matters because people consistently freely make bad decisions . i m more interested in whether that choice made at 12 generally tends to be the correct one for kids later on which i expand upon right below . for the rest , you can look at this pb article https www . tandfonline . com doi full 10 . 1080 26895269 . 2020 . 1747768 . i don t really know what to say except that people are looking into it . i don t know who s saying it s a foolproof medical fact but i m agreeing with the dutch protocol because of the current data , so i ll change my mind if new data shows there s a problem . my issue is that the medical community is not critical enough of puberty blockers . . . whereas this transgender topic , being so highly political and sensitive , has stopped many doctors from even participating , which carries a lot of risk for the children . doctors are reluctant to even conduct studies and that s why we see so few of them . okay you ll have to walk me through this . what is pc culture ? why do you think the tavistock case proves that pc culture is killing trans research , rather than more common issues like lacking funding or trans people being a small population ? what s giving you the impression there s a dearth of trans research anyway ? an example to demonstrate that appealing to authority in the case of transgender research is completely useless . you just appealed to the authority of a court lol . i mean , i guess a court can overrule a medical organization , but if i m looking for which authority is correct about the outcomes of a treatment i d still be appealing to the medical organization . plus the judges made , imo , some glaring errors described below . this case really angered the trans community because funnily enough , the case was brought to court by a 23 year old keira bell who was given blockers at a young age and now regrets it , desists and is suing the nhs for damaging her ability to have children . i d be pretty angry if i or people in my community were suddenly denied medical treatment we needed . it s also a misunderstanding of regret rates . medical regret isn t uncommon e . g 24 . 1 of masectomies https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc3015023 , 18 of knee replacements https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc6961288 . withdrawing treatment for all under 16s for one person regretting starting transition above 16 , the age of medical consent does seem unjust . one trans lawyer deals with some of the philosophical and legal problems here https medium . com empowered trans woman critical thoughts on bell v tavistock 797ca81ed21d . i m guessing that there probably are people looking to overturn the ruling . i ll stick to how i think the judges misinterpreted the studies below 73 the reported qualitative data on early outcomes of 44 young people who received early pubertal suppression . . . noted that there was no overall improvement in mood or psychological wellbeing using standardized psychological measures . emphasis added there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of pbs and what the correct comparison group is . if you receive puberty blockers , it s not expected that your mood improves . you get no unwanted physical changes so your psychological functioning is supposed to be stable . the relevant comparison here is whether if you don t receive blockers , your mood worsens . it s explained in the pb article link above under randomized control trial , to get this data you d need enough patients to consent to not getting pbs , which is unlikely because they are there seeking pbs in the first place . 136 . . . the evidence shows that the vast majority of children who take pbs move on to take cross sex hormones , that stages 1 and 2 are two stages of one clinical pathway and once on that pathway it is extremely rare for a child to get off it . . . to achieve gillick competence the child or young person would have to understand not simply the implications of taking pbs but those of progressing to crosssex hormones . plainly put , this is not what the evidence shows . the court already had several samples of children who take pbs and do not move on to csh , namely children who take pbs for precocious puberty . the text does not mention that pbs did not affect precocious puberty kids gender identities . an obvious interpretation of those numbers is that kids are given pb because the patients , doctors and parents are good at telling if they need pbs or not . and the corollary that if these kids are denied pbs would go on to become increasingly gender dysphoric adults , along with all the psychological difficulties that would result from that , isn t considered . i think the courts are making a mistake , given turban 2020 https pediatrics . aappublications . org content early 2020 01 21 peds . 2019 1725 ?

he made the call in a paper titled equal justice under the constitution and section 377a of the penal code which was published online by the singapore academy of law journal on monday oct 14 .," former chief justice chan sek keong calls for review of section 377a , says law is outdated singapore former chief justice chan sek keong has called for the constitutional validity of section 377a , which criminalises sexual acts between men , to be reviewed . he made the call in a paper titled equal justice under the constitution and section 377a of the penal code which was published online by the singapore academy of law journal on monday oct 14 . advertisement advertisement in his paper , mr chan notes that section 377a criminalises acts of gross indecency between males , whether homosexual or bisexual , but not similar acts between males and females , or between females . he asked whether such unequal treatment violated the fundamental rights of all to equality before the law and equal protection under the law , as provided for under article 12 1 of the constitution . laws differentiating based on sex or gender must have a rational basis , he said , giving the example of parliament hypothetically passing a law against women smoking cigars . if parliament bans women , but not men , from smoking cigars , equality of all persons under article 12 1 requires the state to justify the reasonableness of the ban , said mr chan . advertisement advertisement this could be done on health grounds , if medical research showed women were more prone to lung cancer than men , for example . however , if this were based on parliament finding women smoking cigars undignified or unseemly , the courts would have to consider whether such a reason was legitimate , he argued . citing the case of lim meng suang who launched a legal bid against the constitutionality of section 377a in 2013 mr chan noted the judge at the time had upheld the law on the grounds that its purpose was to criminalise male homosexual conduct , as such behaviour was not acceptable or desirable here . however , the former chief justice noted that section 377a was in fact enacted in 1938 to strengthen laws against male prostitution , which was rife according to crime reports at the time and posed serious problems to law and order , public morality and wholesome government . section 377a was enacted for this purpose , and not because male homosexuality per se was unacceptable in singapore society , he said . the law , he argued , was a product of specific social conditions that have long ceased to exist here . mr chan described section 377a as an outlier in singapore s criminal law regime , and the only genuine gender specific offence in our criminal laws . government sees no legitimate state purpose in enforcement while section 377 under which carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animals was an offence was repealed in 2007 under amendments to the penal code , section 377a was retained . the decision not to repeal was based on the misapprehension that the section covered penetrative sex , a hallmark of male homosexuality , he said . parliament reaffirmed the wrong purpose , he added . furthermore , the decision not to repeal section 377a did not affirm its purpose , said mr chan . he noted mps at the time were not asked to vote on it as the government had already decided well before the parliamentary sitting that it would not repeal section 377a , but at the same time not enforce it . the decision not to enforce section 377a with respect to consensual male penetrative sex in private can be seen as a repudiation of its legitimacy , he said , adding it implies the government sees no legitimate state purpose in criminalising or prosecuting male homosexual conduct . the 1938 purpose became invalid in the eyes of the government in 2007 , he stated . the court must interpret section 377a in a way that does not violate the constitution , which depends on the nature of its inconsistency with article 12 1 , said mr chan . if the original purpose of section 377a no longer exists , it can be construed to conform to the constitution by reading it as a gender neutral provision that criminalises non penetrative sex of gross indecency committed in public , he added . court challenges to 377a to be heard in november the views of mr chan , who served as attorney general ag between 1992 and 2006 together with those of other former ags such as v k rajah and walter woon , as well as current deputy ag hri kumar nair are being cited by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt rights activist roy tan , who filed a challenge against the constitutionality of section 377a in court in september . dr tan , a retired general practitioner who helped organise the first pink dot event in 2009 , is one of three people who have filed court challenges against section 377a since last year . the other two are disc jockey

"the apa has redefined homosexuality from a mental illness to not a mental illness , because american society s perception has changed ."," 4 5 that s more than some of our minority races like the eurasians . are you saying that being a eurasian is abnormal ? exactly , which is why normal as a requirement for treated decently is a horrible requirement . end of discussion then . why keep wasting my time ? sorry , but i just don t see the point of having a conversation that s not going to be based on facts . it d be like debating someone who s anti vaxx or denies climate change if facts can t convince them , why would i waste time convincing otherwise ? because there is more to real life than facts . faith and beliefs are what make humans and society tick . by restricting yourself to facts , you blind yourself from reality , and thus you cannot think or act rationally . it s precisely the delusion that nothing is real except facts , sometimes known as scientism , that has contributed to the anti vaxx and anti climate change movements , because that makes it impossible to communicate with those holding different values . neither can religion ? beyond some book , what exactly is the basis to support the claim the homosexuality is morally wrong ? correct . so if your view and lawrence khong s view are of equal weight according to you , because science has no moral facts and he has no moral facts , and you deny that there is anything beyond facts , why should he listen to you ? meanwhile , science has already established that homosexuality is not a disorder or illness and that both homosexuality and heterosexuality are normal aspects of human sexuality . science has not , because what is defined as mental illness was never scientifically defined , but socially defined . the apa has redefined homosexuality from a mental illness to not a mental illness , because american society s perception has changed . if you come from the viewpoint that social perception is reality . . . then in singapore homosexuality is a mental illness . if you come from the viewpoint that there are only facts and social perception doesn t matter . . . then the apa is unscientific and their view that homosexuality is not a disorder or illness is not a fact . yeah , why are we using morals to decide what rights a group gets ? do note that doing so has resulted in things like slavery , sexism , racism and islamophobia . great idea , right ? huh ? are you implying that your viewpoint is amoral because morals aren t factual ? if you have no morals , then why is treating lgbt people with respect any better than discriminating against them ? how can you even claim anything should be without morals ? the only thing you can conclude would be fact singapore society discriminates against lgbt . the end .

"coincidentally you brought up the point about being antagonistic , but can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being told their narrow minded definitions of marriage should coalesce with the idea of same sex marriage something born out of sexual attraction ?","apologies for a day late reply , was busy . there s alot of angsty downvoters who don t even dare to participate in discourse . you guys are the definition of circlejerk , and the reason why we can t have nice discussions on reddit , grow up please . singapore is a secular nation . marriage is not a religious one but a civil institution as per singaporean law . churches will also not be forced as it is in the us to perform same sex marriages . i never said we weren t a secular nation . i wholly agree we are a secular nation , and i detest people on the white shirt camp who invoke the bible to denounce gay marriage because it s against their beliefs . yes , churches will not be forced , but in the us , those who upset the gay community will face huge budget cuts , threatening their very survival . technically , they are still allowed to reject the marriage of gay couples . while facing minor consequences of course . can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being discriminated against i don t believe in discriminating against gay people . i treat them as fellow human beings . those who discriminate against them are doing so out of fear , and i abhor such practice . would anyone be fine with not having equal rights ? i assume the right you are talking about is the right to marry . this really frustrates me . marriage isn t a right , it s a privilege . which is why in singapore or anywhere in the civilised world , both parties must consent before a marriage licence can be issued . if marriage regardless of the sex was truly a right , we d have a shit ton of problems . we don t have the right to marry animals for example . and this privilege is decided by the state . proponents of gay marriage always argue that marriage is a social construct . this lends even more credibility to the argument that marriage is not something we should inherently be given , it is simply a privilege and a standard we humans have invented , and set to adhere to . are they advocating that christians be stripped of their basic rights a group that actively calls for another to have less rights again , marriage is not a right . unless you are talking about the right to be an individual , the right to be treated as a fellow human being . then what i have written above already addresses this . i don t think the majority of white shirts are advocating discrimination of gays , those who do are the religious zealots , and a convenient straw man for the pro pink dot to attack . would you give anti vaxxers or climate change deniers the same legitimacy these are debates that are fundamentally different in the fact that they do not involve social constructs . let me explain further . we don t give anti vaxxers legitimacy because it is scientifically untrue . if white shirts argued that homosexuality is unnatural , i wouldn t be giving them any legitimacy either , because it has already been scientifically proven it does occur in nature . however , the issue at hand is whether homosexuals should be granted marriage . and this is a social construct , something that science has little authority in . therefore yes , we have to grant the anti gay movement legitimacy because this isn t a science debate , this is a social debate that involves an institutional standard we have believed in and referenced for hundreds , if not thousands , of years . no one s saying homosexuality is a fabrication . but people are saying that marriage should not be extended to include homosexuality . people have followed the traditional construct of marriage for hundreds of years , and allowing homoesexuals to marry on the basis of sexual attraction trivialises this institution . think of it as christianity and buddhism if a bunch of buddhists decided to mix the 2 beliefs together and then proceed to tell christians that they should expand their definition of christianity to include them , aggressively asserting that it is their right to be recognised by christianity while calling others who oppose them as bigots and narrow minded , most people would disagree . because in this scenario you shouldn t be trying to identify with a religion , you have essentially created your own . coincidentally you brought up the point about being antagonistic , but can you really blame people for being upset and frustrated at being told their narrow minded definitions of marriage should coalesce with the idea of same sex marriage something born out of sexual attraction ? i haven t once invoked a non secular argument , and i believe that the secular case against gay marriage can be made . edit formatting",11-06-2016 22:56,Reddit,same sex marriage,-1

"you need to stop weaseling around the main point that you are spreading falsehoods about the catholic and the majority of the local protestant groups , because the issue isn t just 377a ."," first , please , refrain from putting words in my mouth . i only agree that protestants are worse . i don t acknowledge that one group is way worse feel free to quote me . it is very tiring to have to make these corrections , while at the same time being accused by your of lies and misinformation . ok so why call out catholics and angelicans a denomination of protestants who are relatively more passive than groups that organize anti lgbt campaigns as the main anti lgbt group and completely disregard the the groups who are actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? second , i use the term protestants generally simply because you have been using anglicans and catholics . it is long and tiring to have to say the other christians who are not anglicans or catholics , so i have used protestants . if you prefer another label that is convenient , i have no problems using that . thank you for confirming and proving my point . you have deep seated psychological issue that causes you to casually stereotype vastly different groups . here is what you said earlier you seem to be saying that hang on , the protestants are way worse ! they have their wear white campaign , and pray that it will rain on pink dot . you would rather further generalize and stereotype with protestant a 10 letter word , than use the acronyms of the groups that both organize wear white movement and have conversion therapy , both of which contain only 4 characters . essentially you are now saying angelicans , methodists , presbyterians , all of the seven local denominations actively participate in the wear white campaign . and your reasoning is because it is long and tiring . it literally takes less effort to actually not stereotype and name the actual groups . if that s not a prime example of stererotyping , i don t know what is . your psychological issue of casual stereotyping is propagating misinformation and falsehoods , and you need to stop . if you can t , i suggest you seek help , because people like you stir up dissent amongst peaceful relationships . by the way , the notion that not all protestants participate in or even support the wear white campaign , or conversion therapy . can simply be reversed to point out that not all catholics are opposed to wear white or conversion therapy . clearly , you will see variance in the nature of belief in any faith , so any discussion will necessarily have to encompass some degree of generalities . i m sure you recognize a fundamental difference between a group that teaches love and accept lgbt people and a group that teaches homosexuality is a mental illness . you even said it yourself that one is worse . so why are you still sterotyping both groups as one , while naming only the groups that are relatively more supportive and passive by not actually actively organizing anti lgbt movements , while refusing to admit you re willfully being obtuse by choosing to disregard the groups that are organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? i ve already explained that i still regard the differences as fairly minor , in the grand scheme of things . therefore you are admitting that you are sterotyping , and your intention is therefore to stir shit because you know and admit one group is worse than the other but you still support calling the group that is relatively more supportive and passive out and ignoring the group that is actively campaigning against lgbt . i know you re going to deny it , you can keep telling yourself that , but i really don t know how you sleep at night knowing that because you re too afraid to shatter your fragile ego , you refuse to admit that you would rather call the group that teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people out as the largest anti lgbt group while you completely disregard the actual group that organizes anti lgbt campaigns . to me , you are willfully spreading lies and misinformation that all churches have the same stand regarding lgbt , an issue that my lgbt friends and family have shown to be something they care about as it matters to them what their friends and family actually believe . it also matters to them that for all the acceptance of them , the catholic church still does not consider them able to get married . indeed , many might prefer the outright homophobia than that apparent hypocrisy of the catholic church . oh look , another strawman . what does it matter to my lgbt family or friends if the church doesn t consider them eligible for marriage ? they can get married outside of the church . my friend or family member doesn t have to be a christian to be my friend or family . my friend or family member doesn t have to agree with my beliefs to be my friend or family . . what matters to my friends and family is that im not prejudiced against them , nor do i think they have a mental illness that should be cured . you keep talking about 377a as if it s the only issue here , no it s not . you need to stop weaseling around the main point that you are spreading falsehoods about the catholic and the majority of the local protestant groups , because the issue isn t just 377a . it s also about the core teachings of the church and how it affects the daily relationships between lgbt people and church goers . to say that one group teaches love and acceptance and another teaches mental illness is a minor difference , on top of naming only the groups that teaches love and acceptance as anti lgbt out of seven protestant denominations while disregarding the group the teaches mental illness an obvious act of shit stirring . i don t ? for goodness sake for someone that complains over and over about lies and misinformation , you could do well to actually read what you are complaining over . i have clearly explained that while the churches have different approaches it s literally in my first post that the catholic church holds a less critical view , i regard the difference as minor . this is obviously different from the same view . so teaching love and accept lgbt people . don t discriminate , don t judge is a minor difference from homosexuality is a mental illness that should be cured . got it . i understand your stance clearly now . you re a shit stirrer , whether you want to admit it or not . and sorry , catholics are by no means the most supportive of lgbt people . i don t know where this idea is based from , but lgbt find much more support amongst secular support groups than the catholic church . even among religious groups , buddhists are far more accepting of lgbt people . just among christians , it is the free community church not catholic that actually supports lgbt people . come on , are you really that stupid ? is it not obvious enough that i m making the point within the confines of christianity ? let me put it simply for you then since you insist on playing dumb . amongst the christian groups , despite being passively supportive to 377a which is anti lgbt to a minor degree compared to actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns , catholics that teach love and accept lgbt people is the most supportive group compared to other groups that teach homosexuality is a mental illness and groups that actively hold anti lgbt campaigns . . is that better for you ? if you re going to talk about free community church then i m going to ask , why are you shifting the goal post to now include a church that isn t even on the national council of churches ? i literally mention protestants in my first post , which says that both the catholic church and the protestants are the main anti lgbt group . so why not just say christians ? the fact you separate the two groups show that you are not ignorant of the fact they have vastly different teachings regarding lgbt . and since you are not ignorant of that fact , why do you still sterotype them into having the same teaching and stance ? the catholic church is , as a matter of fact , anti lgbt , and you can t run away from that simply because some protestant churches are worse . i never said that they weren t . let me help you establish some facts . 1 the catholic church supports 377a . 2 most protestant groups support 377a . from these two facts , i ll give it to you that they are anti lgbt with regards only to 377a . 3 the catholic church teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people . 4 a certain denomination of the protestants group organizes the wear white campaign , an anti lgbt campaign . 5 a certain denomination of the protestants believe that homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured via conversion therapy . now , you yourself have admitted that there is a difference between the beliefs and teachings of the above mentioned groups . i m leaving out angelicans here for simplicity . however , you are still adamant in saying the difference is only minor , when clearly these teachings significantly affect the day to day relationships between lgbt people and church goers . 6 the person you are defending says that catholics and angelicans are the largest anti lgbt group . 7 the person you are defending clearly knows that he is singling out two specific groups , the catholic church , and the angelican church , which is only one out of at least seven local protestant denominations , and even excluded the non denominational churches by not categorizing the entire group as christians instead . given that the person knows very well there is a distinction between the groups , he still chose to single out group 3 , catholics , and the angelican church , and completely disregard groups 4 and 5 . tell me , what does this behavior look like to you ? why are you defending this ? clearly , you are a shit stirrer .

lgbtq rights do not impinge on the rights of straight people any more than the existence of one colour impinges on another .,"the association of women for action and research aware on thursday 28 july expressed its concern over views aired at a recent closed door townhall calling for the retention of section 377a of the penal code , which criminalises sex between men . in posts on its facebook , twitter and instagram accounts , aware said , rhetoric around protection has been long employed by anti gay advocates . it falsely assumes that the rights and recognition of one group impinges on those of another , as if freedom was a limited quantity that only so many people might enjoy at one time . lgbtq rights do not impinge on the rights of straight people any more than the existence of one colour impinges on another . there are no indications that heterosexual marriages and families will stop being upheld by policies and laws in singapore simply because other people are no longer criminalised . in its social media posts , aware said that section 377a not only stigmatises sex between gay men but also has repercussions on the lgbtq community who continue to face bullying and discrimination . when people cannot be open about their sexual orientation , they face increased stress , limited social support and negative mental and physical health consequences . repealing s377a , and taking other actions to include lgbtq people in society , will be an enormous step towards alleviating this burden . aware noted that the planned renegotiation of singapore s social compact is an important opportunity to create a more inclusive society . we cannot achieve this aspiration , though , if we take for a starting point the denial of the existence and humanity of an entire community , it added .

i would hypothesise that they actually just answered in a way that supports the government s reasoning government says we are repealing 377a but keeping marriage s definition as m f .,"unfortunately i went to watch the whole thing because i wanted to hear them out before commenting . i ll just summarise my observations and give some thoughts . the reporter and the dialogue centre director generally said thing that were more to the side of empathy towards the lgbtq a . k . a queers , i want to use this word instead because it s easier and can represent true community . the reporter didn t say much , and the director mostly shared stories about folks from the queer community . he also shared about how there needs to be civil dialogue , and this point about having dialogue is something that generally everyone in the panel agreed with . he didn t introduce this point btw . most of the sharing came from the pink dot pd rep . he shared experiences about queer folks , highlighted about how everyone should be able to express themselves , have civil discussions and etc . i m feel that he did alright pertaining to the issues discussed , in general . the 3 16 rep was mostly concerned about cancel culture , spoke about how his church helped to equip parents to handle when their children come out , and shared experiences about discrimination from one person who was called a homophobe and was bullied and he claims that person is not actually a homophobe . i hold no love for his pov , what surprised me is that he said he has same sex attraction and shared a bit about his time while he was active in the gay community . the first topic was about today s poll about 377a repeal and same sex marriage is it wrong , and is it important to define it as man and woman . pd rep says it s an opportunity to talk to these people and educate them , while 3 16 says that these respondents likely did their homework and came to the conclusion that marriage s definition as man and woman should stay , citing the if you allow gay marriage , then what s next ? ? ? type of fear mongering . there s a lot that could have been discussed and i think this debate could have taken up the entire hour , but in general i don t like the 3 16 s assumption that all respondents have researched opinions . i would hypothesise that they actually just answered in a way that supports the government s reasoning government says we are repealing 377a but keeping marriage s definition as m f . therefore 377a is bad . uphold definition of marriage as m f is good . we live in a effectively one party state , and i would say that the trickle down of opinions on social matters from the government could be the reason for this . if you disagree with my hypothesis , that s valid . unfortunately the today survey didn t ask why people responded this way . it just noted that religious people were more likely to support 377a s stay , and support the definition of marriage as m f . btw the 3 16 guy said that saying the framing of these statistics shouldn t be confined to religion . this is something that is contradicted by the reporter s article . the article highlights that religious people are the ones who are more opposed to 377a and prefer m f marriage definition . but the reporter mostly just nods as if she doesn t want to say that she highlighted that religious people were more opposed in her article . like , why else would the reporter highlight that religious people were more opposed if it religion isn t a main factor ? anyways then they discussed about the safety of queer folks in sg . generally the director and pd rep said that there s a lot of emotional and psychological damage , and not so much of physical although there is some in the form of getting kicked out of the house for example . 3 16 guy s response was that there are were cases of people having different ideas about queerness who were discriminated . he said i had one guy who was accused of being homophobic despite not being homophobic , and he was bullied . he also had one other example relating to work but it s similar in nature to his point . i mostly agree with the director and pd rep . 3 16 rep was basically pulling the old i m actually the victim card . christians and muslim make up like more than 30 of the population 2020 singstat , while queer people only make up like 12 2022 ipsos as i ve mentioned it s usually religious people who are highlighted as the opposition to queer rights , so i feel that he is wrong to try and play the victim here . the predominant culture has been to suppress queers . this guy even talked about the police raids on gay scenes many years ago . this 12 is the weaker community , whilst the 30 have the numbers and a long standing culture of heteronormativity in the country . is bullying anti queer people wrong ? arguably yes , but it s likely much less of an issue than queer bullying . there was a lengthy session about cancel culture , basically everyone say cancelling is wrong and we should talk things out . i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against . like dude , you learnt to suppress your true sexual self . i would feel bad for you if you weren t part of a church that works to convert people into abstinence from their same sex attractions . also , the issue is not about attraction . who you are attracted to could largely be kept secret . it is hard to discriminate by who youre attracted to . it is , however , easy to discriminate against people who act on those attractions because they are engaging in a physical act that can be caught seen by other people . don t equivocate attraction with the issue being discussed , which is about expressing thoughts and ideas . it s not the same topic and isn t relevant . another thought is that i wish that the pd rep talked about how cancel culture is something that is not just done by the left , it s also done by the right . if i come out to my conservative christian extended family , they aren t going to just agree to disagree they ll call me a sinner and likely ask me to go for conversion therapy or repent . that is cancel culture too . i expressed my thoughts and got shamed , and was silenced and asked to reform . tbc edit some spelling and grammar fixes . lack of brainpower to fix everything",16-11-2022 23:12,Reddit,377a,0

"government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement ."," government considering best way forward on 377a , will respect different viewpoints shanmugam court s decision consistent with past position on 377a mr shanmugam noted that successive court judgments over the years have consistently taken the position that these are highly contentious social issues and within the province of parliament . the heterosexual stable family remains a stable norm , he added . the current legal position reflects our society s norms , values and attitudes . that s what the courts have said . in its judgment , the court noted that the compromise which singapore has struck , in respect to section 377a , is unique , said mr shanmugam . our approach strikes a balance between preserving the legislative status quo , whilst accommodating the concerns of those directly affected by the legislation . the court recognised that the government did this in order to avoid driving a deeper wedge within our society , he added . it also noted that singapore s approach seeks to keep what to do with section 377a within the democratic space . socially charged issues , such as section 377a , call for continued discussion and open ended resolution within the political domain , where we can forge consensus , rather than in win lose outcomes in court . in this way , we can accommodate divergent interests , avoid polarisation and facilitate incremental change , said mr shanmugam . additionally , the court highlighted the importance of creating space for peaceful co existence among various groups , especially since the balance between the various interests around section 377a has grown more delicate . these opinions align with the approach that the government has taken in dealing with section 377a , and that it intends to take as it considers the changes in our social landscape since 2007 . in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong said in parliament , when the penal code was amended but section 377a left unchanged , that we want to be a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society , said mr shanmugam . mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin . this remains our stand today , added mr shanmugam . our emphases on gradual evolution and on traditional families remain constant . shifting attitudes towards homosexuality however , since the issue was last discussed in parliament in 2007 , social attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted , mr shanmugam acknowledged . one of the things that upsets the lgbt community is that many feel that their experience of being hurt or rejected by their families , friends , schools , companies is not recognised , indeed often denied . at the same time , a large majority want to preserve the overall tone of our society , said mr shanmugam . in particular , the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman , and that children should be raised within such a family structure . their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family . many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men . both these viewpoints are valid and important , he added . live and let live approach noting that these are deeply divisive issues , mr shanmugam said that is why the government takes a live and let live approach . we seek to be an inclusive society , where mutual respect and tolerance for different views and practices are paramount . government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement . and agc takes a similar approach . mr shanmugam added that the government had expressly included in the mrha maintenance of religious harmony act that any attack on lgbt groups , or on persons because they are lgbt , will be an offence , and won t be tolerated . lgbt individuals are entitled to live peacefully , without being attacked or threatened , he said . likewise , any attack on any other group , based on their religion , or religious beliefs , even if those beliefs run counter to values held by lgbt groups will not be acceptable . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",03-03-2022 16:08,Reddit,377a,0

gay adoption should be considered within this framework .," forum repeal section 377a , then discuss issues separately in their commentary , section 377a putting children first aug 3 , the authors have conflated different issues in arguing for the protection of children . first , criminalising homosexual sex does nothing to protect children . some sexual acts are riskier regardless of whether they are practised by homosexuals or heterosexuals . moreover , sodomy between consenting heterosexuals was decriminalised in 2007 in singapore . the key is then to educate people to practise safe sex regardless of sexual orientation . second , transgenderism is separate from homosexuality . sexual dysphoria is a medical condition that should be diagnosed by trained professionals , and children should not be allowed to undergo sexual change until their brains are fully developed as adults . we can all agree on this while disagreeing on other issues . third , outside of religion , marriage is merely a legal contract that confers rights such as inheritance as well as division of assets during a divorce . gay couples can have legal civil partnerships without threatening the status of religious marriages . finally , there is no doubt that in a perfect world , we would all live in happy , stable families with our biological fathers and mothers . unfortunately , we do not live in a perfect world . abandoned children need stable , loving adults who can adopt them , regardless of sexual orientation . in singapore , single women can adopt children , and this recognises that there should be no stigma to single motherhood . gay adoption should be considered within this framework . as it stands , section 377a is an archaic colonial era law . it is not enforced and should be repealed . other separate issues can then be discussed by a mature electorate . this is much better than demanding that one s viewpoint be set in stone in the constitution . calvin cheng ern lee 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",06-08-2022 09:11,Reddit,adoption,1

not differ from other children in terms of emotional functioning , sexual orientation , stigmatization , gender role behavior , behavioral adjustment , gender identity , learning and grade point

prevalence of behavioral difficulties to be comparable with population norms . in fact , growing up with parents who are lesbian or gay may confer some advantages to children . they have been described as more tolerant of diversity and more nurturing toward younger children than children whose parents are heterosexual . in one study , children of heterosexual parents saw themselves as being somewhat more aggressive than did children of lesbian parents , and they were seen by parents and teachers as more bossy , negative , and domineering . children of lesbian parents saw themselves

2 population based samples lend additional strength to earlier evidence demonstrating that children s well being is not threatened as a result of growing up with lesbian parents . the importance of

the figure is something close to 100 turning out trans if gender dysphoria persists or worsens after puberty .," i think children s brains are not fully developed that they should be allowed to make life changing decisions when they are kid teens . i do agree with this , which is why doctors and psychs who specialise in treating trans people should be involved , as well as their parents or guardians . more importantly , if a child has reached the point of even being considered for medical intervention it is long and tedious to get there , the odds are highly in favour of them being trans . in that situation , not intervening would be the major life changing decision that s much more likely to have lifelong negative effects . the figure is something close to 100 turning out trans if gender dysphoria persists or worsens after puberty . while there s still the slim possibility that they may not grow up to be trans , if there s a 90 likelihood that they will , then the safest , default course of action would actually be transition . even among the remaining 10 , for them to reach that point would mean they are very gender non conforming . any mistaken medical interventions would thus not have the same impact on them as it would for some random kid . a butch lesbian is less likely to be bothered by having a deeper voice or smaller breasts compared to if it were a super girly girl , for example . i remember reading a study that briefly mentioned some of those youths who were on puberty blockers but eventually decided not to transition , and they did not regret it , especially because the experience proved to them that their parents genuinely cared about their thoughts and what they wanted for their own lives , rather than dictating what they should do .

"besides the usual homophobic nonsense that homosexuality was an unnatural product of sin because god made adam and eve to reproduce despite homosexuality being common not only throughout human history amongst many cultures but in other animal species , he also was a young earth creationist .","oof . . . this kind of fear mongering and homophobia hits close to me . i used to go to a christian youth group in woodlands when i was in my teens and my youth leader also preached a lot of conspiracies that sadly , i believed at the time . besides the usual homophobic nonsense that homosexuality was an unnatural product of sin because god made adam and eve to reproduce despite homosexuality being common not only throughout human history amongst many cultures but in other animal species , he also was a young earth creationist . in short , they read the genealogy in various chapters of the bible literally and calculate it to determine that the earth is only around 6000 years old . as such , they also believe that scientists fake carbon dating evidence that the earth is 4 . 6 billions years ago , that fossils are a product of noah s flood , that macro evolution is another science satanist conspiracy , and of course that dinosaurs lived amongst humans . citing the leviathian in job is a popular example , though most modern bible scholars agree its a mythical sea serpent used a literary device to show god s strength and isn t a real creature . he screened the debate between bill nye and ken ham being on the latter s side ofc , and scheduled bible studies where the focus was on young earth creationism . because i was a dumb lonely teen who wanted approval i bought all of it and got super into creationism , and he even bought me some extra books to do further readings in . thankfully i was able to leave the echo chamber when my family migrated for a year , and the time was enough to realise he been feeding me bullshit . the church i went to in my new country was much more mainstream and i realised that science didn t go against the bible and there was no real conspiracy against christians . i still went back to the youth group after i returned to sg but the spell was broken and i increasingly couldn t accept the lack of logic in his arguments . they were all centred around the idea that christians are this poor victimised group and that we are doing the world tainted by satan this great service by preaching to them and changing them from their sinful ways , sinful meaning anything that was non christian other religions , lgbt , sex before marriage , abortion , etc . ultimately i couldn t accept that morality would be based on one s belief or lack of in a specific deity rather than on ethical principles , and that good non christians would be damned in hell but bad christians could still get into heaven . i also felt that the group i was in were awfully similar to the pharisees in the bible more concerned about the literal letter of biblical law than its spirit , of being kind and loving one s neighbor . i did leave the group , and sadly in the process also lost my faith . i know most christians aren t that radical , but i felt hurt by the way i had been indoctrinated and didn t want to leave anything based on faith alone anymore . i m an agnostic now . tldr if you find being in a religion gives your comfort and helps you be a better person , more power to you . but don t twist religious superstition to scare people into supporting your faith , demonizing minority groups who just want to live their own lives in peace . is it a coincidence that the pride flag has 6 colours ? . . . i mean yes , so does south africa and i don t think you would say they are under satan s influence right ",24-07-2020 15:01,Reddit,homosexuality,-1

"as far as i can see , the pap has judged this correctly and taken their cue from the shifting census that is conducted every couple years that shows sentiment is shifting on 377a and therefore the time has come to act .","i d have thought that the distinction is pretty clear , but if not , let me restate it . sexuality and identity are inherently personal questions which don t require an expert s opinion to answer . these are issues which involve your own moralities and beliefs , and in turn , each individual s beliefs come together to form the consensus of the community . that should be the primary marker for policy on sexuality and identity . not expert opinion . as far as i can see , the pap has judged this correctly and taken their cue from the shifting census that is conducted every couple years that shows sentiment is shifting on 377a and therefore the time has come to act . the science behind homosexuality is the same and has remained unchanged for decades , it is irrelevant at this point insofar as influencing public policy goes . while one can expect an individual to come up with a reasoned position on homosexuality , the same cannot be said of things like economics and law which require extensive study and understanding . these are effectively issues of management , not morality . that s where experts and professionals come in . yes , there often is no consensus but that s what they re paid to do navigate grey areas and chart the best path forward . the government is effectively managing the biggest corporation in the country and the layperson cannot be expected to give valid or informed opinions because they don t have the tools to understand the problems at hand . with issues of simple morality and identity , they can . that s the difference .

"for a lot of people , the argument to keep 377a is like how u described , no one is stopping two adults from doing what they like behind closed doors what .","for a lot of people , the argument to keep 377a is like how u described , no one is stopping two adults from doing what they like behind closed doors what . . and since it s not enforced , there s not much point arguing against it we have to go further than just what happens in the bedroom for that conversation to be meaningful . as it is right now , legal rights like spousal insurance , hospital visitation , maybe even adoption are not readily available to us . we have to jump through a lot of hoops just so we can potentially have those things . but maybe you d ask , need legal protections meh ? why would gay people need those ? see , if me and my bf were to get married one day somewhere else , there s a chance that his siblings or parents can bar me from visiting him if he s critically ill in singapore . i can go on and on , like , what if he needs an emergency procedure ? what if he can t make decisions on his own ? i won t ever get to have a say without having to make arrangements with a lawyer about all these things in advance , simply because i m not recognised as his spouse . also , i cannot use my medisave for him , neither can he , for me . but this is what heterosexual couples can easily do in singapore . if u were to think about it , one of the reasons why insurance companies hospitals wouldn t officially and legally support gays in sg is because if they do , they can be indirectly seen as supporting a potential crime men having sex with men . in the end , a gay person has to depend on the kindness of companies if they want to make spouse related claims . axa famously helped a lesbian couple out a few years ago , thankfully . i m sure you ll agree with me on this u shouldn t have to depend on the kindness of people for your sick spouse to receive adequate and timely medical care . also , as long as 377a is present , moe cannot conduct sex education in a way that addresses all the sexual orientations in a fair manner . we ve all been through growing up and know it can be a jarring experience , trying to make sense of the emotions and insecurities that come during puberty , wanting to be accepted by our peers , and all the while trying to do well in school . now if u were in secondary school , you ll go through sex ed , because it s one of the issues teenagers should learn about . with 377a in place , it is impossible for educators to address homosexuality without potentially talking about sexual activity , and it s a difficult topic to breach because their careers are on the line just imagine if a student goes home and tells their conservative parent that the teacher says it s okay to be gay . the blowback could be really troublesome for the ministry , the school and the teacher to handle . they can t make a statement saying that they want to have a fair discussion about sexual issues , simply because gay sex is illegal in singapore . there s no way to talk about it in a manner that s encouraging or fair without someone saying , government don t encourage , law says it s wrong , is moe trying to encourage our kids to break the law ? i remember growing up in a place where it s super confusing where i literally feel something is wrong with me because no one seems to want to address same sex attractions in a serious manner , even during sex ed ! discussion about gays can very easily degenerate into stuff like , eeee , why would a man wanna poke another man , he ah gua ah . while teachers will try to stop students from being insensitive , they cannot go the extra step of addressing it without potentially risking their career . while 377a is not enforced plainly , it s negative effects can be observed if u look a little harder . so yeah . just my 2 cents of why u might want to consider being against 377a instead of being ok with the status quo .

"in the us , trans people and wrongly suspected trans people have been assaulted or murdered when using public toilets that others thought they should not be using , which isn t likely to happen here ."," ok lets be honest do you think its easier for a predator going into a opposite gender toilet in singapore or in the us where you can go into any gender toilet as long as you claim to be that gender . singapore , actually , based on my experience and that of other trans people i know . singaporeans are very conflict avoidant and try and mind their own business . americans are much more vocal and aggressive , and the first time someone tried to chase me down in the toilet was in the us . in singapore , sometimes they would also shout at me to get out , but it was more common to just get stares . in the us , trans people and wrongly suspected trans people have been assaulted or murdered when using public toilets that others thought they should not be using , which isn t likely to happen here . they re also much more conscious of trans related culture wars since it s constantly harped on in the news there . i understand that the scenario of a sexual predator claiming to be or being a trans woman and entering the women s toilet to assault someone may seem plausible , but in reality it doesn t make sense scenario 1 the women s toilet is in a shopping mall , perky music playing , lots of women walking in and out . suspiciously male looking person joins them . everyone stares . some yell at the person to get out . then . . . what ? the person grabs one of the women and starts assaulting her ? surely the other women won t just whip out their phones to film it and stand around doing nothing while someone gets raped . maybe the person says they re a trans woman , and this makes some women even angrier . others may rise to the person s defense and say go pee , we won t let anyone bother you , and stand outside the cubicle looking fierce . everyone who comes into the toilet gets fascinated by the drama going on . then . . . what ? how will the assault happen with all those people around ? or if instead the person just flashes everyone , they d be going straight to jail , because there s no getting out of that one . scenario 2 the women s toilet is in a quiet area somewhere . it s rare that someone enters . suspiciously male looking person slips in and hides in a cubicle , waiting for a victim . victim comes , and gets assaulted or flashed . but then why bother claiming to be a woman ? there are so many easier ways for sexual predators to assault women , as we see time and again in the news . pretending to be a woman or being a visibly trans woman and assaulting someone in a public space is only going to make them more conspicuous and less likely to get away with it as the spa case shows . i mean , it s an actual wikipedia article , and this was for merely being naked in a pool , not actually assaulting or flashing anyone . how many more men have groped or violated women in private and have that kept secret for decades ? if someone really wanted to assault someone in a public toilet , it would be easier to pretend to be a toilet cleaning uncle . i dont think woman who feel uncomfortable being around and having a naked pre op trans naked woman exposing themselve to them and children in a place where everyone needs to be naked , then complaining to stuff about it have transphobic motives . i d fully agree if she was actively flashing people and maybe she was , or just trying to make a political statement . the same would apply to , say , a man in a non gay men only naked spa staring at other men and slowly stroking his dick , or a non trans woman doing the equivalent in that female spa . most trans people do avoid gendered naked spaces because of the unwanted attention , fear of being questioned , and not wanting to make others uncomfortable , but it s also a form of injustice that trans and intersex people can t access and exist in those spaces and services due to having bodies that are not clearly male or female , and risk being branded as perverts if they do . i m pretty sad about not being able to go to a traditional onsen in japan unless it s a private one on my own . there s no good solution yet , unfortunately .

"also , if the 377a is repealed , the next step is to legalize gay marriage .","1 . yes , op didn t ask for acceptance from every person . however op did talked about the general acceptance of the alt lifestyle as also another normal , from both the workforce and family before moving onto the equality part . quote while 377a is not strictly enforced , it is still in place to preserve traditional family values . we want acceptance from our parents and not have the fear of getting kicked out of the house . we have to be recognised as husbands wives without having the fear that our sexuality will affect our career especially for those in the govt sector . unquote in the last quoted sentence , op seem to imply that the legal effect of gay marriage law will eliminate the fear of their sexuality affecting their career . it is simply not true . stigma can happen in very subtle ways , even if the gay marriage is legal on paper . 2 . op did mention about education . quote and it sucks because of the lack of education about sexuality in singapore . no teachers or adults ever talked about it . unquote there seem to be a suggested frustration towards our current curriculum not being accepting other genders hence it is unable to help confused youngsters come to terms with their ssa . also , if the 377a is repealed , the next step is to legalize gay marriage . absolutely right because it is naturally the next step . now if you have already legalize the act between same sex as well as marriage , shouldn t you also be teaching about the different genders in school as part of sex ed ? how can you accept gay marriage but not change sex ed ? isn t that tantamount to discrimination , no ? on the law level you accept other genders , but in school you don t ? does that make sense ? wouldn t not changing sex ed to accommodate other genders be equivalent to being homophobic ? this is the line of thought . am i jumping the gun ? nope because that s how it was done in the west . it is not logical to only stop at gay marriage . it is the natural road of progression . to say you accept same sex union without changing school curriculum to educate the younger singaporeans on other genders is almost like you look into the mirror , only to forget how you look like after you walk away . 3 . op was using a bible verse to justify how if we love someone , we should accept them as who they are , to which i quoted another bible verse that said about correcting someone whom you love . i was just trying to put that neighbor love into context . that love also includes loving discipline . nothing about correcting anybody . like how a mother would correct a wayward son not because she hates him , but because she loved him . love does not equate full acceptance was the point i was trying to bring up . 4 . well it clearly make difference when it comes to acquiring hdbs and marriage etc . but since op was on the topic of acceptance , it does not make a difference because stigma will still be there anyways . so we repeal 377a ? coz it helps them get hdbs and a proper marriage license ? sounds good . but again , what about point 2 ? it doesn t just stop there . it is not logical . as i have brought up about the gender less toilet in my earlier post , that is also a part of the logical progression . since there are more than just two genders , how can we discriminate the other genders by only having just two gendered toilets ? if the school teaches about multiple genders , why aren t the toilets showing more than two genders ? it happened in the us and children got sexually assaulted by men identifying as female in toilets . all of these will eventually intrude into the lives of the majority because it affects everyone . and you cannot impose the preference of the minorities at the expense of the majority . as for the issue on hdb , well it can be resolved by renting an apartment outside , until you reach the age of 35 . there s no systematic oppression in singapore . homosexuals have their safe space here . they don t get sentenced to jail just for being homosexuals like in the middle east . they get to host pink dot every year without police arresting them and government stopping the event . so things are fine as they are . hence , for the reasons mentioned above , i support 377a . its more than just hdbs and marriage acceptance or even society acceptance . i genuinely hope everyone here at the very least do their own research and look into what happened after gay marriage was passed in other countries . look into facts . not those sensational headlines . if after looking into all of that , you still disagree with me , thats fine with me . really . all i just hope is that everyone arrive at their stand through evidences , facts and logic instead of emotions .

your claim that studies suggest that a very small percentage of people retransition is blatantly false . the number of children who desist their gender dysphoria before age 29 is alarmingly high . i looked at the article you posted in the other comment i couldn t find your 2008 article , it looks like you posted the 2013 steensma article twice . he used the dsm iv definition that is considered outdated that did not require a child consistently state that they are a different gender than that assigned at birth there s an infographic of the changes in this article https thinkprogress . org transgender children desistance a5caf61fc5c6 wrt . dsm 5 . if you include kids who are gender non conforming but don t have a different gender identity , it s likely going to inflate the any desistance numbers . he also included both children without any developed secondary sex characteristics and adolescents who do have some characteristics and are more certain if they want them . from steensma 2011 https sci hub . do https pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov 21216800 the actual physical changes during puberty usually resulted in hatred of and disgust with their bodies . . . as a result of the increased aversion towards their bodies , the girls became insecure with themselves . . . especially the actual physical changes made both boys and girls feel obstructed in their lives , and resulted in a strong desire for medical treatment e . g . , puberty blocking hormones , cross sex hormones , and surgery . this is me editorializing , but the 2013 steensma study wanted to include both trans kids and kids likely to be mistaken for trans kids . he deliberately included sub threshold gd kids and included two questionnaires that had high sensitivity and specificity in that sample adolescents reports of gd and body image were compared across persisters and desisters , and showed that persisters reported more gd than desisters in the mean total scores of both the giiaa and the ugds . clinically , for the giiaa , scores of less than 3 indicate gd 87 . 2 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 0 of the desisters . for the ugds , scores of more than 40 . 0 indicate gd 97 . 9 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 2 . 2 of the desisters 1 bisexual , natal girl . if he was just looking for trans people , he might as well just have stuck with the ugds . he clarifies in this interview https www . kqed . org futureofyou 441784 the controversial research on desistance in transgender youth that the purpose of the study was to find variables that could act as predictors of persistence , not whether currently existing tools can identify trans kids , so it would make sense that he d want both persisters and desisters in his original sample . we re talking about sexual maturity that only triggers on the onset of puberty . we re not , we re talking about gender identity , that the blaunchedcauli correctly said that as far as we know starts being expressed by about age 3 . it is undeniable that puberty causes an immense change in our psychology . to stop a child s psychological development for the sake of a political agenda is child abuse . that s not stopping the development of psychology for the sake of a political agenda . if you think that either testosterone or estrogen are necessary for psychological development then we should be administering that earlier , not later . i ve not seen any negative studies on kids starting puberty at 16 the age of medical consent in the uk and some us states as opposed younger endogenous puberty timings . it s also for the sake of preventing the development of secondary sex characteristics the kids don t want , idk what the political agenda is . 2 . there are medically advised age limits for medications for children with such disorders . . . they re an estimate to do the greatest good . okay so it kind of just looks like you re unaware of what current standards of care for trans kids are . this is based on what i understand to be the current standards of care known as the dutch protocol https www . researchgate . net publication 51768297 treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria in the netherlands . the adolescent should have reached tanner stage 2 to 3 and be older than 12 years of age . starting around tanner stages 2 to 3 , the very rst physical changes are still reversible . some experience with one s physical puberty is required because the authors assume that experiencing one s own puberty is diagnostically useful . it is at the onset of puberty that it becomes clear whether the gender dysphoria will desist or persist puberty blockers pb are only administered after a child has already undergone some pubertal changes , and even then they only delay puberty , where stopping pbs continue endogenous puberty . cross sex hormones are generally only administered at 16 again the medical age of consent in some major countries . we don t have to resort to hypothetical trans kids making a heavy decision , we already have empirical data on whether kids can make this decision in conjunction with a team of doctors and their parents . there are more studies on trans youth than these , but two i m aware of are this dutch study https sci hub . do https www . jsm . jsexmed . org article s1743 6095 18 30057 2 fulltext sec3 . 3 that looked at kids from 1972 2015 and found that only 1 . 9 decided to stop puberty blockers after starting though if i remember correctly they have no figures on anyone who wanted to transition again later and this retrospective study https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc7073269 that found higher suicidal ideation in those who wanted but could not get pb than those that managed to get pb . 3 . . .

it is in our nation s interest to procreate and maintain its own working population . 90 of sgreans live in public housing renters are by and large foreigners , no ? unless you have some source which you can share that im unaware of . my response within my own circle , i do hear a number of sgreans renting public housing , so i do not agree that renters are by and large foreigners . sadly . some reasons includes family problems or no access to credit . to add on i think singles , heterosexual couples , and lgbt couples should all be able to bto . 2 4rm bto , everyone regardless of whether you are single , married , heterosexual or etc needs affordable housing . my response to who need it most . i doubt the lgbt fight overseas actually includes housing as an issue so i presume this is unique to singapore due to lack of land . most likely they will just use one room as their bedroom . proportionating of financial gains subsidized by the govt be part of the consideration , but rather renting is one of the biggest poverty traps , which i . the cost of providing housing is much much cheaper than having to solve the issues from the lack thereof public housing . my response this statement i don t think is correct . if you look at purely the the cost of construction of the house , well it is cheap . but if you look at i would much rather have people be able to self sustain , rather than falling down the poverty cycle and eventually needing to live off the government , which will be much more expensive to the tax payer in the long run my response agree with your statement on self sustainability . nevertheless lgbt and singles does not need to maintain a family nucleus so i don t think they have equal opportunities to housing click to expand . . . my response within my own circle , i do hear a number of sgreans renting public housing , so i do not agree that public housing renters are by and large foreigners this is an opinion , not a factual statement ? how does that prove that most renters are singaporeans ? nevertheless regardless of whether renters are singaporeans or foreigners , you mentioned your main concern is housing prices to finance retirement . but in the first place , housing isnt the primary source to financing retirement . saving , investing and cpf are the three key pillars of retirement for singaporeans . furthermore , singaporeans have low cpf savings and are unable to receive a good payout from cpf life which is the best retirement plan as it is a life long annuity , the root cause of low cpf savings is because singaporeans overspend their oa on property , because housing itself is unaffordable , so shouldnt the government ensure everyone has access to low cost housing bto in non mature estates so they can retire ? wanting to keep property values high is completely contradictory to helping the average singporean especially those who are currently young to retire . to who need it most . should childless couples be able to get 4 room flats and above then ? what if they never procreate ? most likely they will just use one room as their bedroom . proportionating of financial gains subsidized by the govt be part of the consideration , but rather frankly , i think the size is not the issue . since the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . since you think that lgbt singles do not deserve 4 room flats , do you think they should be able to purchase 2 3 room housing which is lesser in space so they can live with a roof over their head ? i would also like to understand more , why do you think childless couples are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples ? my response this statement i don t think is correct . if you look at purely the the cost of construction of the house , well it is cheap . but if you look at the cost of construction , housing is borne by the couples who pay for the flat , im not suggesting anyone receive free housing . the amenities , infrastructure of an estate is not only consumed by one single or one lgbt couple , but rather shared by the entire neighborhood . furthermore regardless of where a person lives , a single or lgbt couple would still consume infrastructure and amenities . furthermore if one does not have access to housing they are more likely to be a burden on the taxpayer through the use of social programs , healthcare etc . i think it is rather easy to see that elevating a person to being a productive member of society by allowing them to be able to afford a roof over their head and being able to contribute to society since they have a stable safety net is much better than them being reliant on handouts when they are stuck in poverty . can you clarify your stance , if singles and lgbt couples do not have housing , what do you think is the solution if not providing btos before 35 even if its just 2 or 3 room flats ?

"these matters faced wide spread and broad lack of popularity , far more than the worst case scenario of every single christian and catholic being a single issue voter who would vote out the government for voting in 377a ."," true we are not single issue voters , but you want to appeal as much as possible to broader audiences . i think this goes back to my earlier point about the reserved presidency , casinos , and even the fake news bill as it was passed . these matters faced wide spread and broad lack of popularity , far more than the worst case scenario of every single christian and catholic being a single issue voter who would vote out the government for voting in 377a . the fact that despite this , we still have casinos , the current president , and the fake news bill , suggests to me that the pap well knows that singaporeans are not single issue voters . consequently the entire political necessity argument stands on shaky legs . history has shown that singaporeans are willing to stomach deeply unpopular issues so long as the government overall is seen to be doing good . unless something drastically changes , the stance for political correctness seems to be not addressing the elephant in the room . which is why in my first post above i mentioned that if we do become a more secular nation , repealing 377a would be the main talking point to appear more progressive . i find the use of political correctness here rather curious , because if you accept that the existence of 377a is not a morally neutral position , and that gay men lack the same ability to legally have anal intercourse , then it follows that 377a is an issue that goes well beyond the window dress of political correctness . it has substantive impact of gay men in singapore a point directly acknowledged by the court of appeal . calling this issue as a a matter of political correctness , fails to account for the substantive effect of 377a . haha i like to think that the imagine part of the sentence whoever compasses , imagines , invents , devises , or intends the death is just legal trying to cover all bases , however silly it may seem in foresight . the word imagine is only used in this manner in relation to the president , and not other crime . it s there intentionally , and not simply legally trying to cover all bases . it literally creates a thought crime . my point in referring to s121a is to draw a direct contrast to crimes that truly are unenforceable . 377a is currently enforced simply because the present government and ag says so . these positions can change in the future , and unlike the thought crime of s121a , there is no technical or theoretical problems with enforcing 377a . it has been enforced in the past , and if the government changes its mind , it can be enforced in the future . the very question i ask myself when they banned a certain band from performing in singapore . the thing about political landscapes is that organised entities always have more negotiating power . they can collectively drop support for a single politician , because they stand together . again , i find this reasoning suspect . in order for this to be a substantive worry , these are the things that would have to happen i christians and catholics vote as a united bloc ii christians and catholics are all single issue voters on and that issue is the repeal of 377a iii christians and catholics are equally distributed across all grcs in the country for maximum effect and iv christians and catholics are willing to vote for the other party , solely based on this single issue . my view is that the more likely scenario is that our government is not as secular as it professes , and that within the government , there is an over representation of christians who are unable to separate their personal religious view on lgbt issues , and the question of whether as a secular nation such matters should be in the law . this explanation is far more likely than the phantom fear of the existence of a large single issue christian voting bloc .

"it s already very much in the trans person s self interest to avoid standing out , and thus it s best they have the flexibility to decide where to go , and to change that accordingly as they progress in transition .","there s no standard answer . it depends on things like stage of transition , whether the person is more often read as male or female , how supportive their friends are especially in a school situation , whether it s covid and they are wearing a mask that covers half their face , etc . e . g . if a trans female student has a group of female friends who are all very supportive of her , and they all go toilet together between classes , then even if she doesn t look like a typical girl it s hard to argue she ll be causing discomfort to others . even if she s secretly a sexual predator or even a cis guy attempting a long con , it s not as though she would suddenly start assaulting random girls while her classmates just stand there with shocked pikachu faces . or if this is a trans person who isn t getting read as the gender they want to , and or who is bullied a lot and has no support , then using the right toilet will also cause discomfort to themselves . everyone will stare and may bully them even more . in that case , no toilet is safe . so they may decide to use the unisex handicapped toilet , and if there s none , they might instead avoid drinking so they don t have to pee at all . dehydration is a common problem for trans students . in other cases there are many trans women who choose to go on hrt before they socially transition . so they look like increasingly feminine men and then decreasingly butch women , and use the male toilets until it hits the point where hawker stall aunties and uncles start calling them xiao mei . they they socially transition and switch to the female toilets . it s why it s a problem when there s any hard rule around this , or saying that toilet use must match ic or genitals . it often ends up overriding common sense and safety and can end up forcing trans people to use toilets that make both themselves and others uncomfortable , or which put themselves in danger . it s already very much in the trans person s self interest to avoid standing out , and thus it s best they have the flexibility to decide where to go , and to change that accordingly as they progress in transition .

"sin and crime the national council of churches of singapore , the catholic archbishop , and the islamic authorities have issued statements against the repeal of section 377a .","singapore was part of the british empire . it was once administered by the british from calcutta kolkata . many of our laws , including the penal code , were imported from india . the indian penal code , in section 377 , criminalises carnal intercourse against the order of nature . sodomy was considered a crime under section 377 . section 377a of the singapore penal code makes it a crime for two consenting male adults to have sex with each other in private . it does not penalise sex between two consenting female adults . the first question is whether section 377a should be repealed . the second question is whether 377a is consistent with our constitution . the scientific evidence singaporeans are a rational people . we make our policies and laws based on facts , science and reason . what is the scientific evidence on homosexuality ? is it a form of mental disorder which can be cured ? or is it a normal aspect of human sexuality ? in 1973 , the world health organisation who deleted homosexuality from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders . this decision was endorsed by the general assembly of who in 1990 when it agreed to delete homosexuality from the list of mental disorders . in who s view , being lgbt lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender is not a disease . scientists do not know what determines a person s sexual orientation , but they theorise that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic , hormonal and environmental influences and do not view it as a choice . they favour biologically based theories , which point to genetic factors . scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in itself a source of negative psychological effects . scientists also believe that there is insufficient evidence to support psychological interventions to change sexual orientation . sodomy and the world the united nations has 196 member states . the majority , 124 states , do not criminalise sodomy . however , the minority of 72 states , including singapore , do . which societies belong to the majority ? all the countries of europe , north america and south america do not criminalise sodomy . it is of interest to point out that china , japan , south korea , hong kong , taiwan , the philippines and thailand also belong to the majority . it is therefore not the case of a liberal west versus a conservative east . which countries make up the 72 which criminalise sodomy ? they are the arab countries , the muslim majority countries and , surprisingly , the former british colonies of asia , africa and the caribbean . singapore is part of the minority mainly because it inherited from the british a penal code which criminalises sodomy . for a country which embraces science and technology , it is surprising that , on this one aspect , the law has not been updated , in the light of the scientific evidence . sin and crime the national council of churches of singapore , the catholic archbishop , and the islamic authorities have issued statements against the repeal of section 377a . they regard homosexuality as a violation of their religious dogmas and therefore a sin . my good friend , former attorney general walter woon , has pointed out that there is a fundamental difference a sin and a crime . he said that many regard adultery and fornication as sinful but these are not criminal behaviour . he concluded that sodomy may be a sin but it should not be made a crime . he is also unhappy with the compromise of retaining 377a and not enforcing it because it brings the law into disrepute . there is an important point which i wish to make to the christian and islamic authorities . i would respectfully remind them that singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian country or a muslim country . it is not the business of the state to enforce the dogmas of those religions . in singapore , there is a separation between religion and the state . church leaders and islamic leaders should respect that separation . role of courts in most cases , the antiquated sodomy laws were repealed by the legislatures of the respective states or countries . however , in a few cases , the laws were declared unconstitutional by the courts . in 1960 , every state of the united states had a law criminalising sodomy . by 2003 , only 14 states , including texas , had such laws . in 2003 , the united states supreme court made a landmark decision in lawrence v texas . the court held , by a majority of six to three , that the texas law criminalising sodomy was unconstitutional . speaking for the majority , justice anthony kennedy said the petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives . the state cannot demean or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime . the ruling in effect invalidated anti sodomy law in the other 13 states as well . but today , 15 years later , most of these states have not repealed the anti sodomy law . however , it is considered unenforceable as the supreme court has ruled it unconstitutional . in september 2018 , the indian supreme court overturned its earlier decision of 2013 , and ruled that section 377 of the indian code was unconstitutional . this was the unanimous decision of a panel of five judges . chief justice dipak misra said that criminalising homosexual sex is irrational , arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional . another judge , indu malhotra , said history owes an apology to the lgbt people for ostracising them . in 2014 , the issue of the constitutionality of section 377a was considered by the court of appeal in the case of lim meng suang v attorney general . the court ruled that the law was not unconstitutional . i believe that the court s judgment was wrong . i hope that the court of appeal will overturn its 2014 decision if it is presented with an opportunity to do so . i will conclude with the following four propositions . first , the scientific evidence is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality . it is not a mental disorder . second , section 377a is an antiquated law , not supported by science , and should be repealed . third , singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian or muslim country . the leaders of those religions should respect the separation of state and religion and refrain from pressuring the government to criminalise conduct which they consider sinful . fourth , the court of appeal should overturn its 2014 decision and declare 377a to be unconstitutional . veteran diplomat tommy koh is chairman of the centre for international law and rector of tembusu college , both at the national university of singapore .

it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not .,"when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021

"we have a good government imo , if we lose this due to 377a or the minority pm issue to our opposition we can kiss our country goodbye .","there s no hypocrisy at all . data shows if there s a non chinese pm fielded , many singaporeans may not be comfortable . this may lead to loss of votes . 377a repeal would also lead to loss of votes for the pap . maybe even more as the christian and muslim religious folk make a significant part of their base . if the opposition wins , or a coalition government is formed where nothing gets done , the country will go to shit . that s the logic i believe at least from the pap point of view . 61 is very close already . as you said , we are a well run technocracy . people are fed , housed and cared for medically . we have a good government imo , if we lose this due to 377a or the minority pm issue to our opposition we can kiss our country goodbye . don t get me wrong , i m 100 for the repeal of 377a . but i understand why the pap is not willing to take this risk . our opposition is too unqualified . imagine charles yeo or chee soon juan or kenneth jeyaretnam in government or having portfolios . our country would die . being a minority myself , yeah it sucks that singaporeans are sort of racist . but their surveys don t lie . if the data shows that singaporeans are not comfortable with a minority pm , i m not gonna sjw force the pap into fielding one just for them to lose the old racist chinese base and possibly lose the election . no thanks . just like for 377a and minority representation , we need to wait for the older conservative folk to die out . the world is progressing forward . the left will win . the progressive will win . the liberals will win . eventually . we just got to wait for the older ones to die out and for us as a country to have more capable opposition .

"all in all , i don t see 377a changing much through legal status unless the court begins to examine extra legal arguments that it s previously rejected , which to me seem necessary to analyze things like whether the law has or has not arbitrarily deprived people of liberty .","i do agree with you , but my worry is that it s an avenue that s already been unsuccessfully explored . here s some scholarship from 2016 reviewing two constitutional challenges thwarted by the supreme court . https ink . library . smu . edu . sg cgi viewcontent . cgi ? article 3875 context sol research in particular the line of reasoning that 377a unfairly deprives people of the the rights to life and personal liberty enshrined in art . 12 of the constitution was overturned by the supreme court , who has interpreted liberty more narrowly as being freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention . to me , this seems a bit odd given that malaysia has interpreted ife in the identical article which we have inherited from their constitution as incorporat ing all those facets that are an integral part of life itself and those matters which go to form the quality of life . in turn , the indian supreme court in interpreting a similar article that malaysia s own constitution was based off has interpreted the right to life as all those rights and aspects of life which would go to make a man s life complete and worth living . the second thing to note is that the supreme court of singapore has been unwilling to involve itself in what are ostensibly matters of social and empirical policy they observe that the right claimed by lim and chee , although of an apparently limited nature , is , in point of fact , not only vague and general , but also contains within itself contradictorily the seeds of an unlimited right . put simply , such a right could be interpreted to encompass as well as legalise all manner of subjective expressions of love and affection , which could in turn embody content that may be wholly unacceptable from the perspective of broader societal policy . in other words , the implication that the court has to make a value judgment that oversteps their authority as a court . a similar logic was also applied to test if the law was arbitrary or absurd since they were conflicted over whether things like sexual orientation occur from birth as opposed to social upbringing choice i suppose . all in all , i don t see 377a changing much through legal status unless the court begins to examine extra legal arguments that it s previously rejected , which to me seem necessary to analyze things like whether the law has or has not arbitrarily deprived people of liberty . perhaps this will change when the penal code amendments go through , although we should also note that these changes would not have been instigated by the supreme court but instead by the committee commissioned and working with minlaw mha . i m not a lawyer , not even a legal student . if i ve misunderstood any legal aspects of the case and previous rulings , please do correct me . i m happy to learn .

tsai yingwen s support for gay marriage was widely used in her campaigns and cited by her supporters .,"i guess we ll have to see what happens in the coming years . tsai yingwen s support for gay marriage was widely used in her campaigns and cited by her supporters . at the very least her campaign thought that it was a useful strategy to highlight this . being anti china is a factor yes but most commentators i ve read also cited gay marriage legalisation for her overwhelming electoral success amongst young voters . also the idea that the young people become more conservative as they age has been debunked by more recent research . based on what i ve read , the latest surveys show that people s political position tend to become calcified instead of regress after a certain age . the perceived phenomenon you mentioned comes from the fact that society tends to liberalise over time , such that a formerly extremely liberal position held by a person in his 20s for example supporting civil unions for gay people but not full marriage equality will become a conservative position by the time he is 40 since gay marriage may already be fully legal at that point . in other words , political views are more generational than age based . see this pew paper for info https www . pewresearch . org fact tank 2014 07 09 the politics of american generations how age affects attitudes and voting behavior i didn t say that we will get to lgbt equality through activism right here right now . my argument was more about future demographics . yes , voters may be apathetic now , but whether or not you agree with the sjws , there are few topics that are as emotionally charged as racial and lgbt issues even lw agreed see his comments about importing culture wars and i think a substantial number young people , if sufficiently mobilised , will eventually vote on this issue . i think we will eventually reach a point whereby planting a flag on the ground as being pro lgbt could be a winning political strategy for an ambitious up and coming political party or perhaps an older technocratic party hoping to shore up its youth support . i admit that this is speculation , but that s my perhaps overly optimistic prediction .

if your answer is no then there are only three logical possibilities of your behaviour 1 you are a troll 2 you are ignorant 3 you are wilfully trying to stir shit edit in reply to your earlier rebuttal of the similarities between you sterotyping all christians as anti lgbt and all muslims as terrorists 1 the quaran teaches that all who don t believe in allah are infidels . 2 the bible teaches that a man having sex with a man is wrong . 1 and 2 are parallels . 3 most muslims are loving and accepting toward the infidels 4 most angelicans and catholics are loving and accepting toward homosexuals . 3 and 4 are parallels . 5 isis is a terrorist group that actively kills innocent infidels . 6 a certain group of protestants not the catholics or angelicans actively campaign against lgbt people . 5 and 6 are parallels . 7 you are sterotyping groups 3 and 4 with groups 5 and 6 , and go even further by naming groups 3 and 4 while completely disregarding groups 5 and 6 and their actions which undeniably have a much greater impact . if this isn t called stirring shit , then tell me what it is . if you want to talk about disavowing and publically condemning , then you should be aware that the protestants exist because they condemn and publically disavow the teachings of the catholic church , and vice versa . what one denomination of protestants actively do has nothing to do with the catholic church , and vice versa . together with the fragmented protestant groups , i think organized christianity here is pretty much in the bigot camp . it is evident from your statement that you have no idea what you are talking about . christinaity refers to catholics , protestants and non denominational churches who claim to base their beliefs on the teachings of jesus christ . by saying together with the fragmented protestant groups . . . organized christianity it is clear you don t understand that protestants are part of the organized christianity group . furthermore , i m fairly certain that you mentioned catholics because you misunderstood what was written in the article you initially posted https en . m . wikipedia . org wiki homosexuality and the anglican communion church of the province of south east asia specifically this statement the said confirmation therefore seriously raises the question of ecusa s genuine commitment to our corporate responsibility as members of the church catholic to uphold and promote only the apostolic faith and order inherited . a natural , holistic and consistent reading of the scriptures clearly show that it is against the practise of homosexuality . in case you didn t know , the church catholic and the catholic church are two completely different things . the word catholic means including a wide variety of things and has nothing at all do with the catholic church . that being said , you mentioned organized christianity is in the bigot camp . by christianity do you mean all christians including catholics ? if so , please explain to me how teaching catholics to love , accept , do not judge lgbt people constitutes bigotry intolerance ? my point is that the rest of the silent majority of christians aren t any better if they allow themselves to be represented this way . this is exactly what i m opposed to . you are spreading misinformation and falsehoods , saying that all christians allow themselves to be represented by what lawrence khong teaches . that is a blatant lie and you need to stop stirring shit . there is a fundamental difference between what lawrence khong teaches and what the catholic church teaches regarding lgbt , and they by no means represent each other at all . i don t know about what the angelican church teaches , but as far as i know , they have not participated in any active discrimination against lgbt people here , nor have they stirred up any dissent like what lawrence khong has done . it is because of people like you that i have to always explain to any new lgbt person i meet that just because i m catholic , it does not mean i am prejudiced against them , and i have nothing to do with conversion therapy or the wear white movement , that my church s stance on lgbt is to be loving and accepting and not judge or discriminate . i m sure a lot of christians face similar problems , and by propagating these falsehoods you are only serving to cause dissent between the lgbt community and christians who are actually loving and accepting , and cause unnecessary anxiety to both the lgbt and majority of the christian community here .

you may view yourself as being neutral but the fact is that you do have an interest in making lgbtq citizens miserable with your promotion of conversion therapy and argument against the repeal of 377a .," as a guy , being able to achieve orgasm , also means that some degree of sexual gratification was achieved . let s say a skilful girl was able to give a homosexual guy an orgasm . it might not be as good as homosexual intercourse , but it s not zero . kevin durant publicly offered to drink scarlet johansson s bath water . he hasn t been successful thus far , going by public record . that doesn t mean that he s given up on sex with anyone else . umm . . orgasm does not mean sexual gratification . it is your body s response to stimuli usually at the erogenous regions but you can still orgasm without enjoying it . if i m talking about weed , then it s much easier being an advocate for 377a , than weed . since only one of them runs the risk of a jail term . it is a promise that could easily be revoked for 377a . take note that they had also used other laws to conduct anti gay operation with a recent one being done in 2010 . also , 377a has been reported https sacc . aware . org . sg get involved your stories to prevent male sexual assault victims from speaking up . so it s not even about a law that isn t enforced . but about everything else after . so even overturning the law wouldn t satisfy the lgbtq community . now i can see why those protect s pore people talk about a larger agenda . while the lgbtq movement says it only doesn t want to be treated as criminals . it is the symbol of the discrimination faced by lgbtq people . is equal rights really a larger agenda ? would you be happy to live with the exact same constraints as us ? perhaps you would like to try it and see why lgbtq people are unhappy with the status quo ? racial equality is mentioned in our pledge enshrined in our constitution . yet it obviously hasn t stopped racism . so even if 377a was struck down , societal acceptance might not necessarily follow . but it did result in a huge improvement where we no longer have such severe racial tensions that would have resulted in racial riots . although racism is not fully removed , it is still a huge step from the past . now science can be used to prove if something might be harmful . but i ve yet to heard about scientific experiments , used to show , if something is ethical or not . in fact , i think that making conversion therapy torturous guarantees failure . the idea is has to be about making it pleasurable . else how does one convert ? but i don t think such experiments are allowed , in this day and age . and how do you propose that ? if you are so certain that conversion therapy works , why not do it on yourself . open yourself to the possible trauma that you propose on inflicting on others ? apart from our legacy british penal code . the barriers you mentioned are there , because it has the complicit support of the majority . most people want a traditional nuclear family unit . while the government wants these units to produce more babies , thus the incentives given to do so . untrue . most of the complicit support are just apathy with some vocal groups bringing in bigotry from western influences . if we removed every single neutral voices , there is a bigger argument for the repeal of 377a . it s not all difficulties , without any benefits . the lack of children means that gay households have more disposable spending power . it s the power of the pink dollar , that brought one of the largest annual gay dance parties to sentosa , once upon a time . so you are saying that there are benefits to being discriminated against ? there are childless straight marriages as well . and they benefit given that they can bto whereas a gay couple intending to stay together will have to pay the extremely high price for a resale and be locked out of certain regions too . where is the increased disposable spending power ? also take note that there is discriminatory hiring which results in lgbtq citizens usually being forced to only get low paying jobs . is that a benefit ? and for pink dollar , the companies profit off of it whereas lgbtq people gain nothing from it . following this line , maybe the lgbtq community can strive to make more money . which will improve their lobbying power . money makes everything easier . it s something our policy makers take into account . perhaps if we do not face discrimination during job hunts ? where disclosing that you re lgbtq will not result in an instant rejection or not getting the chance of an interview ? and ultimately , i didn t write our laws . nor do i plan my day , around making the lgbtq community miserable . neither the larger public , who have bread butter issues to stress about . and yet you consistently argue against allowing lgbtq people equal rights . you have spent hours on a work day arguing for something that will make the lgbtq community miserable . you are also not the only one doing this . you may view yourself as being neutral but the fact is that you do have an interest in making lgbtq citizens miserable with your promotion of conversion therapy and argument against the repeal of 377a . how would straight couples appreciate more competition for their btos ? so we straight up don t deserve housing as singapore citizens ? we all pay the same taxes , we all contribute to singapore , we should all get the same rights and chances at btos . there are so many childfree straight couples who get btos . should we then insist that all of them forfeit their housing to couples that have children ? if you truly care about the finite resource of btos , combating flipping of hdbs and preventing people from having more than one house would probably do a lot more than barring lgbtq people from bto . anyway , i m more than happy . to put the issue to a public referendum . because you know that the bigots are still vocal and a huge percentage are apathetic enough to be happy with continuing discrimination . would you be happy if we have a public referendum regarding your rights ?

which is a sum more people can hit if they housing was more affordable and their oa wasnt subsidized to an unaffordable housing market .,"concernedsgrean said my response i never say most renters are singaporeans ? i am just rejecting your statement that quote 90 of sgreans live in public housing renters are by and large foreigners . if this is your opinion , that s fine by me . housing instalments are paid by cpf , so housing value indirectly is one of the primary source for retirement . if you are praying for low cost housing bto and resale value , then how are the retirees getting back their cpf money to fund for their retirement ? optimally housing resale price should grow in sync with cpf accrued interest . should childless couples be able to get 4 room flats and above then ? what if they never procreate ? my response i explained myself earlier on this , you can read my post again . frankly , i think the size is not the issue . since the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . since you think that lgbt singles do not deserve 4 room flats , do you think they should be able to purchase 2 3 room housing which is lesser in space so they can live with a roof over their head ? my response the size of 4 room is two times that of a 2 room . singles can purchase 2 room housing , which should be more than sufficient for one person . even many retiree couples also stay in a 2 room housing . for a lgbt couple , my suggestion as a work around is to first get a 2 room bto and then get a 3 room in the resale market when reach the age of 35 . it is normal for couples to upgrade their housing over time . i would also like to understand more , why do you think childless couples are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples ? my response . i explained myself earlier on this , you can read my post again . click to expand . . . . housing instalments are paid by cpf , so housing value indirectly is one of the primary source for retirement . if you are praying for low cost housing bto and resale value , then how are the retirees getting back their cpf money to fund for their retirement ? this is a misunderstanding of retirement in singapore as a whole . the vast proportion of retirees receive income in the form of annuity payouts from cpf life . this annuity premium , is paid at 55 , largely from the retirees special account which is independent from housing . housing values do not need to be exponentially increasing . if housing prices are cheap , people spend less on housing , more money is channeled to sa or kept in oa which earns guaranteed interest of up to 3 . 5 and 5 respectively , this forces mandatory savings and provides compound interest to allow their savings to grow at an exponential rate to pay for cpf life premiums for their retirement . thus it is cpf sa mainly through the use of compound interest that can fund retirees retirement . frs and ers has an estimated payout of 1800 , and 2500 respectively a month . which is a sum more people can hit if they housing was more affordable and their oa wasnt subsidized to an unaffordable housing market . my response i explained myself earlier on this , you can read my post again . i did read the initial post however your argument did not make sense as the lack of kids at present does not imply that they will have kids in the future so it is a foregone conclusion . singles can purchase 2 room housing , which should be more than sufficient for one person . even many retiree couples also stay in a 2 room housing . for a lgbt couple , my suggestion as a work around is to first get a 2 room bto and then get a 3 room in the resale market when reach the age of 35 . it is normal for couples to upgrade their housing over time . so you agree that singles and lgbt couples should be able to get housing before 35 ? if so , we agree , the only point i disagree is that 2 room is sufficient for 2 people . i do not wish for singapore to go down the road of hong kong .

"no single gay person is saying there should be a ban on churches and jesus , in the name of homosexuality ."," traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . again , this goes back to the problems of proposing that marriage should be measured by its reproduction potential . let me quote myself again marriage cannot be defined by its reproduction potential . if so , then thousands of heterosexual couples without children should not be allowed to marry . there are also countless heterosexual couples who plan to never have kids . do we ban them from marrying as well ? under the same logic , people who are infertile or above the age of child bearing should not be allowed to marry too , since reproduction is out of the question . also , in singapore s context , malay families traditionally have more children than non malay ones . given your reference , are you suggesting that malay marriages are superior to non malay ones because they are more ordered toward procreation ? you cannot keep redefining marriage to suit your narrative . marriage has never been about reproduction hetero sex is , and even that isn t its only purpose . marriage is about love and commitment between two persons . are you going to suggest that there be a law that bans all sexual activity which does not result in conception ? one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . again , i can bring up countless studies and examples if you wish to know more . countless books have been written by the children of same sex couples . in fact , same sex couples are a lot more involved in parenting . i have never heard of a same sex parent who hasn t read at least one book on parenting . have you read any books on parenting ? my parents have never done that . they probably don t even know books on parenting exist . are you saying my family did not provide the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of me ? because that s what you re saying . it imposes its acceptance on all society . this is a common fear among those who oppose equality , so i d like to bring some attention to it . no , it doesn t impose anything on you or me , for that matter . even when same sex marriage is legal , i will still find it icky . i will still let my sons know that pussies are more fun not sure what i ll do with daughters , honestly . legalizing it does not force you to accept it . if you have a problem with it , you can still express it . you can still preach against it in churches and mosques . you can stop your children from having gay friends or friends with gay parents , and you can still tell them how immoral and wrong it is . you can even refuse to make wedding cakes or take wedding photos for them . there is pretty much nothing you need to do to accept same sex marriages . by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . on the same stroke , by banning same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active discriminator . by banning same sex marriage , the state is saying these people are less of a human because marriage is for normal human beings only . should the state be able to do that ? should we allow the state to determine that a gay person is less of a human ? . . . punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . sorry to break your bubble , but this part of the article does not apply to singapore . we already have anti discriminatory laws at the work place . state employees who expresses beyond just personal disapproval will already be punished . same for expressions against gender , race , and religion . try going to your work place and announce i do not want to work with these women because women are stupid and see what happens . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences . . . i am not a christian . i am a straight man who believes , strongly , about equality and the benefits of a more equitable society . are you saying i am not a person of good will ? because that s what you re saying . are you saying i m betraying my conscience ? because that s what you re saying . also , if you do not want others to attack your christian morality , why do you , then , insist on attacking our non christian morality ? why do you expect homosexuals to betray their conscience ? why do you want to silence them ? gays are not forcing christians to stop practicing and believing in their faiths . no single gay person is saying there should be a ban on churches and jesus , in the name of homosexuality . why are you trying to impose your belief on others by using the law , in the name of christianity ? this , in essence , is the complete immorality of your position , which brings me to the point about your religion it offends god first , let me just ask the rhetorical question how do you know ? are you god ? second , as an atheist , and millions like me , and millions more who are non christians , we reject your god , either in its meaning , its existence , or both . you may not impose it on us with the law , because the law does not belong to you . but that s the beauty of it , because similarly , we cannot use the law to ban christianity , or ban you from practicing your faith , no matter how much some of us would like to . third , what about the fact that your god wants you to treat every man as his brother , and that you must never judge as only god can judge , and that god loves everybody ? imagine 2 christians one vehemently against homosexuality and same sex marriage . the other who accepts and loves everybody , including gays , as equal . each professes their actions in the name of god . who is right ? who s wrong ? do i throw them a couple of knives and let them fight it out , and accept the answer of the one who wins ? that is your dilemma . the interpretation of religion is , in and of itself , subjective . you may not subject your subjective interpretation of morality onto the rest of the population using the law , because that s what slave owners did . that is far more immoral than anything you have conjured up against same sex equality .

likely that i will get downvoted to oblivion , but i thought i d just put some thoughts out too . i have not read any of truelove . is https truelove . is s articles and i am not trying to represent or defend their words and actions . i am putting out my personal belief on what the christian faith is meant to be , and what i think that means in this context . i am simply trying to clarify any possible misunderstandings of what christianity represents to anyone who may view christianity negatively because of this . i will not discuss if homosexuality is actually a sin or not , and will not debate this with anyone , because i don t believe that such a debate will go anywhere for anyone . anyway , here is what i believe internalised homophobia come to think of your attractions as dirty , sinful , hell worthy through social programming and peer influence , internalise the thought that you are exceptionally and profoundly flawed . well , to be honest , everyone does things hell worthy . doesn t matter whether its a lie , anger , or a murder . i m not sure about you , but i think i m flawed , and that s why i need the grace of god in my life . so yes , gay or not , i don t think anyone is perfect and deserves to be spared from hell . but there comes the part where it s god s grace through the death of jesus that gives us a way back . self flagellation reinforce the inferiority from 1 by reminding yourself of the need to purge yourself of homosexual desires in order to escape hell yet , these desires return , and your daily struggle between purity and damnation continues . again , no one is perfect and we all have different areas that we need to improve in . but i don t believe god expects perfection out of us . we re simply not capable of that . instead , he wants us to simply do our best . so yes , we should always be struggling to change whatever we know that isn t right that we re doing i . e . addictions , negative thoughts , bad habits . but again , it doesn t mean that if we don t do enough , we re going to hell . because salvation is not achieved by how good we are , but by the grace of god . what this means is that even if we do everything wrong in our life , it doesn t mean that there s no way out of hell . on the flip side , it also doesn t mean that if we only do a little wrong , we re fine . rather , it means that what determines if we go to heaven or not is simply whether we believe in what jesus did for us and accept that gift of salvation . again , i understand if you do not believe in christianity or god , i am simply putting out what i believe in and what i feel that the church and truelove . is https truelove . is should be presenting . to put this in a more straightforward way , it means that when i want to change myself and fix what i think or know i m doing wrong , it s not because i m scared of going to hell . it s because i love god and want to give my best to him . coming out come out to your society as one struggling with ssa invite more people into your structure of sexual policing , so that self flagellation is reinforced by the threat of actual social condemnation . the church should never be condemning or segregating anyone who is lgbt . if anyone here has faced discrimination by the church or people in the church , i would like to apologize on behalf of them . i believe that when someone comes out as lgbt in the church and wants to change , it should always be out of their own convictions , and not social pressure . the church should always be there to support people who want to change , not coerce people into thinking what they do is wrong . support , not condemn . going back in you realise that even though you pray and talk about it , your ssa never goes away you think this reflects badly on your own piety you entrench your social position as that person who struggles with ssa . soon , you become defined both by your ssa and your failure to move past it . become the subject of failure , in a repeated but never perfected act of failing . you internalise the judgment of your society . i think this isn t something that is limited to ssa . it s the same thing for alcoholism , drugs , bad habits , addictions , and really whatever else . it s always a struggle to change the ways that you re so used to . if we removed the negative connotations , i guess you could compare it to trying to adjust to a new culture . anyway , i believe that we re all works in progress , which means that you struggle , i struggle , we all struggle . but we struggle together and run together . and it also doesn t mean that if i can t find a breakthrough , i m a failure . instead , to me , it takes time . it takes me to really rely on god for help , because i cant breakthrough by my own ability or strength . i would want to emphasize again that the motivation to change any behaviour or mindset for me is always out of love for god . it s not because i have to , or just because it s right . it s always a matter of conviction . life goes on around you , but not in you your straight friends move into relationships , get married , live unified lives . you remain chaste , celibate , and you feel loneliness make its home in your heart . surely , holiness is its own reward . i don t have much to comment on this , other than i guess time will tell ? as aforementioned , i don t intend to make any case for whether homosexuality is a sin or not . learning to love the abuse tell yourself that the trauma you suffer from the above processes is a badge of honour that you happily wear in order to prove your piety you link your socially conferred sense of self worth to pain that is transmuted into pleasure . true love is straight love , and since that is what you can never experience , it is something you don t deserve . i don t fully understand what this statement means , so if op or anyone else could kindly explain it to me , i would be glad to share what i think as well . however , i do not think true love straight love , and i will talk about that as well in a short while . x200b i think to summarise everything i ve said here , what i truly believe true love is , is well stated by 1 corinthians 13 4 7 . 4 love is patient , love is kind . it does not envy , it does not boast , it is not proud . 5 it does not dishonor others , it is not self seeking , it is not easily angered , it keeps no record of wrongs . 6 love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth . 7 it always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres . and to be honest , i don t think any of us are capable of this fully , at all times . not you , not me , not the senior pastor of a church , not the smartest theologian . only god has this love , and i will always be thankful for it . our human love will only be so much but a fragment of that . so no , true love isn t a matter of sexual orientation . x200b edit thanks for the gold , kind stranger ! edit 2 since everyone seems to be telling me i m missing the point , you re absolutely right . i m not trying to make an argument or prove anyone wrong . so yes , i am missing the point . i m just trying to shed light on what we christians see , from my perspective .

professionals specialised in treating the transgender community , after the gender identity clinic at national university hospital closed in 2008 .","singapore even though information about transgender issues has proliferated across the internet and become more accessible , people in singapore who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria still find it difficult to find resources here and get adequate medical treatment and acceptance , experts and transgender youth said . gender dysphoria refers to the psychological discomfort or distress experienced by an individual who believes that there is a mismatch between his or her sex and his or her gender identity . non governmental organisations ngos who support transgender people told today that gaps still remain even though healthcare accessibility has improved over the years . many healthcare professionals still lack the knowledge to treat transgender people , and public information about the resources available remain scarce and inaccessible , they said . transgender youth who were interviewed said that they face inadequate support at home and in school , and struggle to gain acceptance . unlike many other social taboos that have been shed , the taboo associated with transgender issues is still there and it has contributed to some of these problems , the ngos said . read also moe denies stopping transgender student from getting hormone therapy , says it is in no position to interfere with medical treatments they added that this stigma and the inadequate institutional support is damaging to students with gender dysphoria , some of whom have even resorted to buying hormone replacement pills from unauthorised websites . these gaps were thrust under the spotlight two months ago , when a transgender student named ashlee alleged that the ministry of education moe had prevented her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone replacement therapy , the treatment recommended for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in a 2016 study by medical journal the lancet , estimates suggested that about 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 per cent of the global population are transgender . there is no official estimate of the number of transgender people among singapore s population . healthcare accessibility opened in 2017 , the gender health clinic under the institute of mental health imh is believed to be the only public hospital in singapore to have a team of medical professionals specialised in treating the transgender community , after the gender identity clinic at national university hospital closed in 2008 . transgender patients who wish to seek help from the clinic can get a referral through public hospitals or polyclinics . read also review of singapore s mental healthcare system underway , as mps highlight existing gaps however , transgender sg , an organisation that collates resources for the transgender community in singapore , said that getting this referral is not that straightforward , because many public healthcare workers do not know what to do when a person with gender dysphoria approaches them . this was the case for kaeden lim , 17 , who sought professional medical support from regular psychiatrists at a public hospital when he was 12 due to struggles with gender dysphoria and his mental health . it took more than a year and four psychiatrists before he was finally referred to imh s gender health clinic . today spoke to kaeden s parents , who confirmed that kaeden is a patient at the gender clinic and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2018 . the teenager recalled how even after he had told the doctors that he identifies as a transgender male , they continued to use female pronouns when addressing him . it was only at the imh gender health clinic that kaeden received the support he was looking for when a doctor at the clinic validated his experience as a transgender person . read also decisions on use of hormonal therapy rest with clinicians and their patients moe , imh all three transgender students whom today interviewed said that their experience at the gender clinic was affirming and positive . their frustration , though , lies with having to wait around three months between appointments because there are only a handful of doctors servicing the clinic . when contacted about the issue , imh declined to comment . there are options available for patients to go to a private doctor for medical support , but many choose not to because the prices for private consultations can be up to two to four times higher than public consultations . professor tsoi wing foo , a psychiatrist in private practice who has treated patients with gender dysphoria for 50 years , said that some patients choose to go to him for treatment first while waiting for an appointment in the public hospital , which can take a few months . since 2007 , he has seen 1 , 000 patients with gender dysphoria . most of his patients are between the ages of 18 and 30 . read also gender dysphoria schools can work out practical arrangements with students if there are valid medical grounds , says lawrence wong the young people interviewed by today said what makes matters worse is that information and resources for healthcare support is not easily accessible . for instance , they found out about how to get a referral to the imh gender clinic through a private online community and the information was not available publicly . transgender sg has a list of healthcare providers that cater to transgender people , but it does not make this information public due to fears of societal backlash . lack of social support then , there are some young transgender people who are unable to begin hormone replacement therapy due to lack of support from family . this was the case for lexi not her real name , who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019 . lexi let today see the appointment cards , receipts and correspondence from a hospital showing that she is a patient at the imh gender health clinic and has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in singapore , individuals below 21 have to get permission from their parents before they can be referred to an endocrinologist , who specialises in treating conditions related to hormones and hormonal glands . because lexi s parents are against her medically transitioning , the 18 year old has resorted to buying hormone pills off unauthorised websites without a prescription . she relies on the accounts of other transgender women to figure out how much to take . the ngos told today that this is a common occurrence within the community for those who do not have support to transition but are desperate to start the process . doctors are warning that buying and using hormones from websites can be dangerous . dr abel soh , an endocrinologist at mount elizabeth hospital , said that there are many unbranded hormone treatments available online that may not necessarily provide the same concentration of hormones stated . taking hormones without monitoring their levels in the blood via blood tests may potentially result in excessive usage , he said . agreeing , dr ben ng from arden endocrinology specialist clinic said that gender transitioning is a complex and multi pronged process . professional evaluation from a medical doctor is necessary to ensure that the therapy prescribed is appropriate and safe . both specialists said that taking the wrong prescription of hormones could lead to significant health problems , including increased risk of blood clots , heart disease and stroke . even when transgender students have family support , they might feel alienated in school because the institutions often are not equipped to help them , the patients and experts said . for instance , students face hurdles over which uniform they can wear or which toilets they can use . this was the case for junior college student jules not her real name , who started hormone replacement therapy last year . today confirmed with jules parents that she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and is seeing a doctor at the imh gender health clinic . during a disagreement with the school over which uniform she should wear , the 18 year old was asked to wear a lab coat over her physical education attire during science practical class . jules said that this has made her feel more anxious because she now stands out among her peers , who wear either long pants or skirts during these lessons . she has also resorted to drinking as little water as possible and holding her bladder to avoid using the bathroom in school . if i could describe it in one sentence , it s like i m going out with an extremely bad haircut every day just constantly being self conscious because of this

i will not be talking about the veracity of whether homosexuality is a choice or not because it s out of scope and the ppl you ve interacted with probably thinks it s a choice by default anyways .,"sorry but while it may appear there is logical consistency at first glance , you will find that there is still no logical consistency once you dig deeper into the methods that this petition calls for . let me break it down for you . i will not be talking about the veracity of whether homosexuality is a choice or not because it s out of scope and the ppl you ve interacted with probably thinks it s a choice by default anyways . premise ppl believe homosexuality is a choice . you can just pick and choose who you re sexually and romantically attracted to any time , any day . we can further extrapolate that to changing sexual orientation is possible if you just make up your mind on it . by that logic , pinkdot don t need to be ban even if teenagers are known to be easily influenced by things around them because they can just choose not participate in homosexual activities just like how there are plenty of teenagers who choose not to smoke or do tidepod challenge , or any other kind of vices even after being exposed to such info . in fact , there s also no virtue to banning it because a teenagers who are interested will seek it out regardless of the medium in which the information exist in internet , books , school sex ed , friend etc b teenagers with anti establishment streak will actively seek out such material by sheer virtue that it s something their parental figure do not want them to see . to counter a , the banning of pinkdot will not even be remotely effective as there are plenty of lgbt materials on the internet , some even more explicit than just words and pink lights . to counter b , the banning of pinkdot also wouldn t even be remotely effective either as the taboo nature of the material makes those teens even more curious about it , further increasing their chances of being influenced by it . so this is not only ineffective but may even end up being counterproductive . therefore the logically consistent choice here would be to provide the teenagers with the necessary materials to make an informed choice i . e making up their minds rather than banning it and pretending it doesn t exist .

"you could say it s similar to s377a in initial comment to me , you made that comparison stating imagine using this argument for section 377a .","the reason why laws have meaning is due to the deterrence effect it has or the legitimacy it provides . the reason why s377a has so much effects on lgbtq citizens daily lives is not solely due to what it does but rather the discrimination it legitimizes by implicitly labeling us as criminals because we technically break the law if we have any intimacy , even in private . we can t have same sex marriage legitimized , can t officially protect lgbtq under tafep , can t even have positive representation of lgbtq in local media because it will contradict s377a . mhra does not do that . thus the only other way it has meaning is if it protects lgbtq from religious motivated violence . however , if it is not enforced , then the protection is moot . you can claim that it is a huge step forward but to us , it feels like pure lip service . even after the change to mhra , we still have waapd posting stuffs that are just enough to avoid being explicit threats of violence which is enough to prevent them from being charged under mhra . there s even one on twitter that threatened a religious jihad and wanted to be a vigilante to stop the lgbtq degeneracy and nothing happened to him . when the change was made to mhra , we celebrated thinking it was a step forward like you . but it s been made obvious that it s just a show . you could say it s similar to s377a in initial comment to me , you made that comparison stating imagine using this argument for section 377a . however , as i have mentioned before , there is a huge difference in the effects of the laws being in place . so since you say you didn t claim mhra has an effect on people s daily life , i ask you this one thing . how is mhra meaningful ? if it does not deter people from making the threats , and those making the threats still go unpunished by avoiding crossing a line that is really hard to cross unless you re really stupid . i get that you want to see mhra as a significant step forward for lgbtq rights in sg . however , the truth is that we do not feel protected even after the change in mhra . i still see hate speech online whenever lgbtq issues in sg occur even after the change in mhra . and that makes mhra meaningless to me . whereas s377a has meaning as it legitimizes all the discrimination i ve faced , that is ok to not hire me or fire me just based on who i am because i m not covered in the protected class of the constitution which is partly due to s377a . you can call me biased or whatever . but i ll stick to it .

? ? why so triggered ? got your panties in a bunch now that you ve admitted to being a filthy liar and a disgusting anti lgbt weasel ? of course i read what you said , and it had no relevance whatsoever to what was being discussed . there are two different definitions of homosexual . one of them , is an adjective , referring to sexual acts performed by two people of the same gender . another one of them , is a noun , referring to someone having a sexual attraction to someone of the same gender . the priests are not homosexuals noun , because they do not have a sexual attraction to someone of the same gender . but they have committed homosexual adjective acts , because they did perform sexual acts on someone of the same gender . lol what a load of bullshit . i can t believe you re still trying to bring up this strawman that an adjective is being discussed when clearly right from the start i was responding to this post https www . reddit . com r singapore comments lnd00t student pleads guilty to molesting schoolmate gnzte42 ? utm medium android app utm source share context 3 that is clearly referring to the orientation of the sex offenders . my whole point was dispute this misrepresentation of associating the sexual orientation with the church abuse cases , but here you are still doubling down on defending anti lgbt lies . noun applies here , because the sentence is not be viewed as pedophiles , but as homosexuals . there s an s in the homosexuals , indicating that they are using it as a noun . exactly , thanks for confirming my point . so you re saying it changes the information given by the noun sex offender ? because that makes it an adjective , pal https en . wikipedia . org wiki adjective nouns can function as adjectives , pal https learningenglish . voanews . com a everyday grammar when nouns act like adjectives 2998821 . html oof . imagine being schooled on english basics . obviously the comment made isn t homosexual acts committed by heterosexual sex offenders . then again if you employ the level of mental gymnastics you are using , maybe that s a slight chance someone as deranged as you could arrive at that conclusion . your argument that this is the lesser known definition isn t valid since its literally in the first line of the wikipedia page on homosexuality https en . wikipedia . org wiki homosexuality also in the very first line , it is says romantic attraction , sexual attraction before it lists or sexual behavior as the last point . it then follows up expanding on as a sexual orientation . . . britannica definition https www . britannica . com topic homosexuality , sexual orientation . merriam webster first definition https www . merriam webster . com dictionary homosexuality , sexual orientation . oxford definition https www . oxfordlearnersdictionaries . com definition english homosexuality , sexual orientation . you can cut the bullshit here . homosexuality in reference to the action and not the orientation is proven to be the lesser used definition . the catholic church has a pedophile problem , not a homosexual one they have mainly a pedophile problem , but most of the pedophilic crimes done by catholic priests were homosexual in nature . emphasis that only the crimes are homosexual in nature . this is exactly my point , that the priests aren t homosexual in nature and thus this post https www . reddit . com r singapore comments lnd00t student pleads guilty to molesting schoolmate gnzte42 ? utm medium android app utm source share context 3 that is clearly referring to the orientation of the sex offenders has absolutely nothing to do with the church abuse cases . thank you for proving my point . the priests aren t homosexuals , and no where in any of my posts did i say they were homosexuals . you were defending the person who claimed that they were . homosexual sex offenders have been around since forever , just look at the catholic church . like you said , they aren t homosexual in nature . yet here you are still trying to associate homosexuality with pedophilia . yeah , agreed . i tested you to see if you were reading carefully , and you failed . you failed to provide a contrasting comment in your prior reply , proving that you made a mistake here and you failed your own test . now that i have shown you that you were tested , can we go back to discussing the actual context of the question ?

"yes , which is why singaporeans also support allowing same sex married couples to adopt ."," your opinion of the greater bad , you mean . not mine though . discrimination is bad . is it not perfectly right for mps representing the west coast grc to voice these concerns in parliament ? can you tell me how same sex marriage would affect a particular constituency more than another ? go on . ah , now i see . your idea of objective is to completely ignore feelings . do you even know what objective means ? liking durians is a subjective feeling , but the fact that people like durians is an objective fact . yes , and those are two separate things that you are , once again , trying to falsely conflate . not supporting same sex marriage because you feel it is wrong is subjective . it is an objective fact that there are people who oppose lgbt rights . but i m not denying the objectivity of the latter , i m asking you to provide an objective justification in using the former to discriminate against the lgbt community . why would you ignore objective facts about subjective feelings ? they re not irrelevant . people act based on feelings , and those actions change the world . that is fact . nope , feelings are not an excuse for discrimination . they certainly are terrible ways to implement policy . can you imagine if our monetary and diplomatic policies were based on feelings ? can you imagine if your rights were based on what politicians feel ? lol . and really , when talking about objective facts about subjective feelings . the objective facts is that some subjective feelings are objectively wrong because they hurt others . go address that instead . isn t that a subjective feeling that people have ? yes , but i m maintaining consistency . if those opposed to same sex are going to invoke the majority argument , then that should equally hold when the majority shifts . i don t like double standards , do you ? and i ve already given you objective reasons beyond feelings for why same sex marriage should be legalized . can you give a single objective reason why it shouldn t ? singapore has a strong cultural link between marriage and children . yes , which is why singaporeans also support allowing same sex married couples to adopt . there is no data from countries legalizing same sex marriage showing that it has any impact on birth rate . that causes your point . 1 to fall and every subsequent one to be irrelevant . because of 4 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage will damage the cultural link between marriage and children . refer above . your argument is based on a vacuous assumption . do you know what damages the cultural link between marriage and children ? divorce and adultery . ban those things instead . make them illegal . from 2 and 5 , a policy of legalising same sex marriage will result in less people having children . why would it ? give any source showing that happening in other parts of the world . want another good counter to your point ? the countries with the lowest birth rates are all the ones without same sex marriage being legalized . you can make an even stronger argument for same sex marriage on that basis that allowing for same sex couples to have children via surrogacy boosts birth rates . i believe this is a valid argument yes , it s too bad that your subjective belief isn t supported by objective data . how do you find this argument ? i asked for an objective reason , not a subjective one . as mentioned objective not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts . belief the feeling of being certain that something exists or is true , especially one without proof . a belief is a personal feeling . without proof , you are not representing facts . you have failed to meet both qualifications for objectivity .

"chief justice dipak misra said that criminalising homosexual sex is irrational , arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional .","singapore was part of the british empire . it was once administered by the british from calcutta kolkata . many of our laws , including the penal code , were imported from india . the indian penal code , in section 377 , criminalises carnal intercourse against the order of nature . sodomy was considered a crime under section 377 . section 377a of the singapore penal code makes it a crime for two consenting male adults to have sex with each other in private . it does not penalise sex between two consenting female adults . the first question is whether section 377a should be repealed . the second question is whether 377a is consistent with our constitution . the scientific evidence singaporeans are a rational people . we make our policies and laws based on facts , science and reason . what is the scientific evidence on homosexuality ? is it a form of mental disorder which can be cured ? or is it a normal aspect of human sexuality ? in 1973 , the world health organisation who deleted homosexuality from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders . this decision was endorsed by the general assembly of who in 1990 when it agreed to delete homosexuality from the list of mental disorders . in who s view , being lgbt lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender is not a disease . scientists do not know what determines a person s sexual orientation , but they theorise that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic , hormonal and environmental influences and do not view it as a choice . they favour biologically based theories , which point to genetic factors . scientific research has shown that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation in human sexuality and is not in itself a source of negative psychological effects . scientists also believe that there is insufficient evidence to support psychological interventions to change sexual orientation . sodomy and the world the united nations has 196 member states . the majority , 124 states , do not criminalise sodomy . however , the minority of 72 states , including singapore , do . which societies belong to the majority ? all the countries of europe , north america and south america do not criminalise sodomy . it is of interest to point out that china , japan , south korea , hong kong , taiwan , the philippines and thailand also belong to the majority . it is therefore not the case of a liberal west versus a conservative east . which countries make up the 72 which criminalise sodomy ? they are the arab countries , the muslim majority countries and , surprisingly , the former british colonies of asia , africa and the caribbean . singapore is part of the minority mainly because it inherited from the british a penal code which criminalises sodomy . for a country which embraces science and technology , it is surprising that , on this one aspect , the law has not been updated , in the light of the scientific evidence . sin and crime the national council of churches of singapore , the catholic archbishop , and the islamic authorities have issued statements against the repeal of section 377a . they regard homosexuality as a violation of their religious dogmas and therefore a sin . my good friend , former attorney general walter woon , has pointed out that there is a fundamental difference a sin and a crime . he said that many regard adultery and fornication as sinful but these are not criminal behaviour . he concluded that sodomy may be a sin but it should not be made a crime . he is also unhappy with the compromise of retaining 377a and not enforcing it because it brings the law into disrepute . there is an important point which i wish to make to the christian and islamic authorities . i would respectfully remind them that singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian country or a muslim country . it is not the business of the state to enforce the dogmas of those religions . in singapore , there is a separation between religion and the state . church leaders and islamic leaders should respect that separation . role of courts in most cases , the antiquated sodomy laws were repealed by the legislatures of the respective states or countries . however , in a few cases , the laws were declared unconstitutional by the courts . in 1960 , every state of the united states had a law criminalising sodomy . by 2003 , only 14 states , including texas , had such laws . in 2003 , the united states supreme court made a landmark decision in lawrence v texas . the court held , by a majority of six to three , that the texas law criminalising sodomy was unconstitutional . speaking for the majority , justice anthony kennedy said the petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives . the state cannot demean or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime . the ruling in effect invalidated anti sodomy law in the other 13 states as well . but today , 15 years later , most of these states have not repealed the anti sodomy law . however , it is considered unenforceable as the supreme court has ruled it unconstitutional . in september 2018 , the indian supreme court overturned its earlier decision of 2013 , and ruled that section 377 of the indian code was unconstitutional . this was the unanimous decision of a panel of five judges . chief justice dipak misra said that criminalising homosexual sex is irrational , arbitrary and manifestly unconstitutional . another judge , indu malhotra , said history owes an apology to the lgbt people for ostracising them . in 2014 , the issue of the constitutionality of section 377a was considered by the court of appeal in the case of lim meng suang v attorney general . the court ruled that the law was not unconstitutional . i believe that the court s judgment was wrong . i hope that the court of appeal will overturn its 2014 decision if it is presented with an opportunity to do so . i will conclude with the following four propositions . first , the scientific evidence is that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality . it is not a mental disorder . second , section 377a is an antiquated law , not supported by science , and should be repealed . third , singapore is a secular state . it is not a christian or muslim country . the leaders of those religions should respect the separation of state and religion and refrain from pressuring the government to criminalise conduct which they consider sinful . fourth , the court of appeal should overturn its 2014 decision and declare 377a to be unconstitutional . veteran diplomat tommy koh is chairman of the centre for international law and rector of tembusu college , both at the national university of singapore .

"rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public .","when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021 19:59,Reddit,trans,0

"because rights are not intrinsic , but are fundamentally creatures of societal morality which may be enshrined as laws ."," adopting that has given us slavery , racism , sexism , homphobia and now islamophobia . but the converse is also true , as society develops over time , its collective moral opinion progresses and it gradually decide that these abhorent practices are wrong and to be abandoned . no one 100 years ago could have predicted the tremendous advancements in gender rights , for instance . if our children s generation decided that beef is immoral due to its carbon footprint , would you like your grandkids to condemn you for enjoying a sirloin steak ? i don t know about you , but a government relying on morality from the majority , especially if it s not a factually supported position , seems to cause many issues . as long as governments make policies based on morality it will primarily take into account the moral values held by the majority of the population , whose support it relies on . otherwise , how do you think governments should decide on questions of morality ? why are we using subjective morality to govern what rights another person has again ? because rights are not intrinsic , but are fundamentally creatures of societal morality which may be enshrined as laws . for example , an american has the right to bear arms because of the second amendment , but the second amendment remains in place despite all the school shootings because it is indelibly etched into the american psyche that guns are a fundamental liberty . at heart , rights only exist because a state is willing to exert force to preserve them , or restrict its own power in respect of these rights . but this only happens if enough people believe that all people should be entitled to them , and would support a government who enshrine them into law . otherwise , the only rights you will have is what you can defend . x200b ",02-04-2019 21:42,Reddit,rights,0

"i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against .","unfortunately i went to watch the whole thing because i wanted to hear them out before commenting . i ll just summarise my observations and give some thoughts . the reporter and the dialogue centre director generally said thing that were more to the side of empathy towards the lgbtq a . k . a queers , i want to use this word instead because it s easier and can represent true community . the reporter didn t say much , and the director mostly shared stories about folks from the queer community . he also shared about how there needs to be civil dialogue , and this point about having dialogue is something that generally everyone in the panel agreed with . he didn t introduce this point btw . most of the sharing came from the pink dot pd rep . he shared experiences about queer folks , highlighted about how everyone should be able to express themselves , have civil discussions and etc . i m feel that he did alright pertaining to the issues discussed , in general . the 3 16 rep was mostly concerned about cancel culture , spoke about how his church helped to equip parents to handle when their children come out , and shared experiences about discrimination from one person who was called a homophobe and was bullied and he claims that person is not actually a homophobe . i hold no love for his pov , what surprised me is that he said he has same sex attraction and shared a bit about his time while he was active in the gay community . the first topic was about today s poll about 377a repeal and same sex marriage is it wrong , and is it important to define it as man and woman . pd rep says it s an opportunity to talk to these people and educate them , while 3 16 says that these respondents likely did their homework and came to the conclusion that marriage s definition as man and woman should stay , citing the if you allow gay marriage , then what s next ? ? ? type of fear mongering . there s a lot that could have been discussed and i think this debate could have taken up the entire hour , but in general i don t like the 3 16 s assumption that all respondents have researched opinions . i would hypothesise that they actually just answered in a way that supports the government s reasoning government says we are repealing 377a but keeping marriage s definition as m f . therefore 377a is bad . uphold definition of marriage as m f is good . we live in a effectively one party state , and i would say that the trickle down of opinions on social matters from the government could be the reason for this . if you disagree with my hypothesis , that s valid . unfortunately the today survey didn t ask why people responded this way . it just noted that religious people were more likely to support 377a s stay , and support the definition of marriage as m f . btw the 3 16 guy said that saying the framing of these statistics shouldn t be confined to religion . this is something that is contradicted by the reporter s article . the article highlights that religious people are the ones who are more opposed to 377a and prefer m f marriage definition . but the reporter mostly just nods as if she doesn t want to say that she highlighted that religious people were more opposed in her article . like , why else would the reporter highlight that religious people were more opposed if it religion isn t a main factor ? anyways then they discussed about the safety of queer folks in sg . generally the director and pd rep said that there s a lot of emotional and psychological damage , and not so much of physical although there is some in the form of getting kicked out of the house for example . 3 16 guy s response was that there are were cases of people having different ideas about queerness who were discriminated . he said i had one guy who was accused of being homophobic despite not being homophobic , and he was bullied . he also had one other example relating to work but it s similar in nature to his point . i mostly agree with the director and pd rep . 3 16 rep was basically pulling the old i m actually the victim card . christians and muslim make up like more than 30 of the population 2020 singstat , while queer people only make up like 12 2022 ipsos as i ve mentioned it s usually religious people who are highlighted as the opposition to queer rights , so i feel that he is wrong to try and play the victim here . the predominant culture has been to suppress queers . this guy even talked about the police raids on gay scenes many years ago . this 12 is the weaker community , whilst the 30 have the numbers and a long standing culture of heteronormativity in the country . is bullying anti queer people wrong ? arguably yes , but it s likely much less of an issue than queer bullying . there was a lengthy session about cancel culture , basically everyone say cancelling is wrong and we should talk things out . i can t really be bothered to document too much so i ll just talk about snippets and my thoughts i hated that the 3 16 rep said yeah of course i agree , i also experience same sex attraction so it s in my interest to not to be discriminated against . like dude , you learnt to suppress your true sexual self . i would feel bad for you if you weren t part of a church that works to convert people into abstinence from their same sex attractions . also , the issue is not about attraction . who you are attracted to could largely be kept secret . it is hard to discriminate by who youre attracted to . it is , however , easy to discriminate against people who act on those attractions because they are engaging in a physical act that can be caught seen by other people . don t equivocate attraction with the issue being discussed , which is about expressing thoughts and ideas . it s not the same topic and isn t relevant . another thought is that i wish that the pd rep talked about how cancel culture is something that is not just done by the left , it s also done by the right . if i come out to my conservative christian extended family , they aren t going to just agree to disagree they ll call me a sinner and likely ask me to go for conversion therapy or repent . that is cancel culture too . i expressed my thoughts and got shamed , and was silenced and asked to reform . tbc edit some spelling and grammar fixes . lack of brainpower to fix everything",16-11-2022 23:12,Reddit,same sex,1

lgbtq issues a researcher on the panel said that while people are tolerant of friends or co workers in same sex relationships , they apply other values such as their moral views on family a gay panellist who helms a podcast said that there needs to be accurate representation of lgbtq individuals in the media it is not possible for everyone to come to a consensus on lgbtq issues , but there must be a willingness to talk , he added singapore young singaporeans are less accepting of family members having same sex relationships than they are of their friends and colleagues as they apply different values on both groups . while they apply tolerance on their co workers , other values such as their notions of morality or the traditional family unit come into play when dealing with a family member . researcher mathew mathews , who was speaking during a today live webinar on friday nov 19 , said so in my family setting , i would want that value to operate . i need people to live within a certain kind of boundary . dr mathews , who heads the social lab at the national university of singapore s institute of policy studies , was commenting on the findings of the today youth survey 2021 . the survey , which polled 1 , 066 respondents between the ages of 18 and 35 in early october , found that more than 70 per cent of respondents were willing to accept friends or work alongside those having same sex relationships , but 58 per cent were willing to accept family members who do so . relating his personal experience , another panellist on the webinar , mr yeo sam jo , said that the difference in attitudes towards friends or family members who are homosexual could also stem from a place of concern . mr yeo , who helms the sg boys podcast that discusses gay issues , said that when he finally told his parents last year that he was gay , his mother expressed concern over whether he would face discrimination at work or be treated differently by people due to his sexual orientation . i can t speak for why there is a discrepancy in the survey results as a whole but if you go by a case by case basis , i think a lot of it really boils down to the stigma of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq identity , he said . friday s webinar was streamed at 8pm on today s instagram and tiktok accounts . the topic for the second instalment of this year s four part webinar series was on youth attitudes on lgbtq issues . the event was moderated by cna presenter elizabeth neo and also featured today s supervising editor yasmine yahya as a panellist . media portrayal of lgbtq community the panellists of the webinar also discussed the portrayal of lgbtq individuals in the media . today s survey found that a third of the respondents 33 per cent felt that the community was positively portrayed , while almost half 46 per cent were neutral about it . about a fifth 22 per cent said that the portrayals were negative . on this , mr yeo said that it was not just enough to have representation of lgbtq individuals on screen , but also have accurate portrayals that did not dehumanise , rely on tropes or portray such individuals in a negative light . he cited the example of the chinese language drama series , my guardian angels , which aired on mediacorp s channel 8 last april . the series had faced criticism for featuring a paedophile character who molested teenage boys and had sexually transmitted diseases as well as a character who was worried about the sexual orientation of her son . mediacorp had apologised last july for causing offence and distress , and reiterated that there was no intention to depict the lgbtq community in a negative light in the series . such portrayals perpetuated stereotypes of the lgbtq community , such as how gay people spread sexually transmitted diseases and are sexual predators , mr yeo said . as individuals with aspirations and dreams , members of the lgbtq community would appreciate positive portrayals in the media , he added . on the portrayal of lgbtq issues in the news media , ms yasmine said that today is still navigating its way on how to report such issues fairly without flouting laws on how they could be portrayed . today has thus tried to centre the community s voice in an accurate , fair and non judgemental way in the hope that reports on lgbtq issues will be read by the wider public , she said . legislation the panellists also touched on the question of whether lgbtq individuals can be equals in singapore without legislative changes , such as the repeal of section 377a of the penal code that criminalises consensual sex between men . to this , ms yasmine said that only time will tell if there will be legal changes in singapore , but in the meantime , individuals can create safe spaces for lgbtq persons in their work settings , social spaces or at home . mr yeo said that even if section 377a is repealed , mindsets about the lgbtq community , such as how it is here to tear apart the fabric of society , must also change . if anything , we are all for stability and cohesion as well . we want to be part of this society as much as you are . we want to feel like we belong . building consensus ms neo asked the panel about the concerns of people in society who are opposed to the normalisation of lgbtq issues . dr mathews said that it stems from how people frame the idea of a family . these segments of the population have questions about an alternative way of running a family , whether it would be viable and its impact on children of homosexual families . on whether different segments of society will ever reach a consensus on lgbtq issues , ms yasmine said that it is not possible to convert everybody . drawing parallels with the feminist movement , she said that there will always be pushback from society whenever progress is made . however , society must keep fighting for change while trying to reach across the divide and build bridges between groups who have opposing views , she added . agreeing , mr yeo said that it is not possible to force someone to agree in something they do not believe . however , it is important that the different groups are mature and open minded enough to listen and be receptive to what the other side is saying . he added if there s no willingness to sit down and have a proper discussion , then the battle is already lost .

9 per cent were not in favour of gay marriage .,"article repost slightly more than half or 55 per cent of singaporeans still support section 377a of the penal code , even as one in three singaporeans is more accepting of same sex relationships than he or she was five years ago , a new survey has found . the online survey by ipsos public affairs , an independent market research company , was conducted over a period of four days from end july to early august 2018 to understand the current social attitudes towards same sex relationships . a total of 750 singaporean citizens and permanent residents aged 15 to 65 took part in the study . when asked the extent to which they supported or opposed section 377a of the penal code , which is the law that criminalises consensual sex between adult men , more than half 55 per cent indicated that they supported it , while 12 per cent said they opposed it . sentiment varied according to gender , with males more likely to strongly support the law than females . singaporeans aged 15 to 24 were more likely to oppose the law , while singaporeans aged 55 to 65 were more likely to support it . singaporeans were also asked the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the statement i believe that singaporeans should be able to participate in same sex relationships . twenty eight per cent agreed with the statement , while 38 per cent did not . a 2014 survey of more than 4 , 000 singapore residents conducted by the institute of policy studies similarly found that singaporeans are largely conservative . in the study , 78 . 2 per cent of respondents said that same sex relationships were wrong , while 72 . 9 per cent were not in favour of gay marriage . however , 33 per cent of singaporeans in the ipsos study agreed with the statement i am more accepting of same sex relationships than i was five years ago , while 35 per cent disagreed . the survey results come as the question of whether the law would be repealed in singapore was raised after the indian supreme court struck down a similar section of the indian penal code last thursday sept 6 . since then , online petitions to keep it and repeal it have been started by separate groups of individuals . when asked about the indian ruling last friday , law and home affairs minister k . shanmugam said in singapore if you look at this issue , it is a deeply split society . the majority are opposed to any change to section 377a , they are opposed to removing it . however , he said a growing minority want to have it repealed . the government is in the middle , he added . last saturday , he said that whether section 377a will be repealed or amended will be a matter for parliament to decide . he added that depending on the legislation , public opinion is often relevant during policymaking in parliament . ipsos said the findings indicate that attitudes towards the issue of same sex relationships have changed and are likely to continue to change , albeit at a slow pace . this change was attributed to perceptions of shifts in singapore s social norms with respect to same sex relationships , increased conversations on social media and more direct exposure to same sex relationships . said ipsos associate research director robert mcphedran this research indicates that the normative values of singaporeans with respect to lgbtq lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer issues are gradually shifting . he added as has occurred in other countries globally , increased dialogue regarding same sex relationships has contributed to higher acceptance among singaporeans . this is particularly the case for the younger generation . nonetheless , as pm lee has previously noted , a social consensus remains far from being reached .

"legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality ."," it is not marriage calling something marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order established by god , one sins and offends god . same sex marriage does just this . accordingly , anyone who professes to love god must be opposed to it . marriage is not the creature of any state . rather , it was established by god in paradise for our first parents , adam and eve . as we read in the book of genesis god created man in his image in the divine image he created him male and female he created them . god blessed them , saying be fertile and multiply fill the earth and subdue it . gen . 1 28 29 the same was taught by our savior jesus christ from the beginning of the creation , god made them male and female . for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife . mark 10 6 7 . genesis also teaches how god punished sodom and gomorrah for the sin of homosexuality the lord rained down sulphurous fire upon sodom and gomorrah . he overthrew those cities and the whole plain , together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil . gen . 19 24 25 ",11-06-2015 10:18,Reddit,same sex marriage,-1

"for example , trans people have been allowed to compete in the olympics according to their gender identity since 2004 with medical restrictions .","banning trans girls and women from sports won t make it easier compared to things like increasing funding , hiring better coaches and encouraging girls who are interested and skilled in sports . even for trans women who might have a small advantage in a particular sport , the many more disadvantages they face more than cancel those out . for example , trans people have been allowed to compete in the olympics according to their gender identity since 2004 with medical restrictions . the first one to qualify was a trans male cyclist in 2016 , who competed against men . the first trans woman to qualify was only in 2021 , and she didn t win any medals . there are over 10 , 000 athletes in the olympics each year . trans people make up about 0 . 5 of the population , so if everything were equal , there would have been about 900 trans olympians by now . if trans women alone have an unfair advantage , the numbers would still at least be in the high 100s . but there have only been 5 trans olympians so far , and only 2 were trans women one weightlifter and one backup cyclist . so we just don t have the evidence that trans women pose a threat to female sports , whether or not they have physical advantages . it s even less likely in singapore , where people are much less into sports since we focus more on exams , and trans girls women especially are less likely to pursue something seen as stereotypically manly .

public toilets are a source of major anxiety and stress for most if not all trans people .," and as such i think its appropriate that the usual societal norms apply instead of giving transgender people a choice use the toilet corresponding to the sex you are most commonly identified with , not your gender . while i agree on principle , the problem with that framing is that it implies trans people aren t already doing so , and need a law to tell us what is basically common sense as well as a matter of our own safety . so that can come across as patronizing and is one reason for the backlash . it s more or less standard practice for trans people to only switch toilets once they re regularly read as that gender , and to use unisex handicapped toilets or not go at all when in early transition . public toilets are a source of major anxiety and stress for most if not all trans people . so the idea that someone would willingly choose to use a toilet where they stand out more and thus experience more stress is counterintuitive . it s also typically the trans person experiencing the greatest discomfort in those scenarios , whereas i find that a lot of those examples tend to assume that it s everyone else who is uncomfortable while the trans person is totally chill . i thus believe that trans people should have a choice , because figuring out what toilet you should go to is stressful enough without bringing the threat of the law into it . sometimes it s based on fluctuating criteria like if 4 out of 5 strangers a trans woman met today addressed her as xiao mei , then she would be better off in the female toilets . but if she just had a haircut and everyone has been calling her xiao di , then maybe she ll choose to use the male toilets on that day . there s really not much incentive to do otherwise , unless someone wishes to intentionally stand out to make a political statement but that s another matter altogether , and wouldn t apply to most cases . especially when it s singaporeans , who are mostly obedient and afraid of confrontation .

singapore , said that getting this referral is not that straightforward , because many public healthcare workers do not know what to do when a person with gender dysphoria approaches them .","singapore even though information about transgender issues has proliferated across the internet and become more accessible , people in singapore who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria still find it difficult to find resources here and get adequate medical treatment and acceptance , experts and transgender youth said . gender dysphoria refers to the psychological discomfort or distress experienced by an individual who believes that there is a mismatch between his or her sex and his or her gender identity . non governmental organisations ngos who support transgender people told today that gaps still remain even though healthcare accessibility has improved over the years . many healthcare professionals still lack the knowledge to treat transgender people , and public information about the resources available remain scarce and inaccessible , they said . transgender youth who were interviewed said that they face inadequate support at home and in school , and struggle to gain acceptance . unlike many other social taboos that have been shed , the taboo associated with transgender issues is still there and it has contributed to some of these problems , the ngos said . read also moe denies stopping transgender student from getting hormone therapy , says it is in no position to interfere with medical treatments they added that this stigma and the inadequate institutional support is damaging to students with gender dysphoria , some of whom have even resorted to buying hormone replacement pills from unauthorised websites . these gaps were thrust under the spotlight two months ago , when a transgender student named ashlee alleged that the ministry of education moe had prevented her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone replacement therapy , the treatment recommended for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in a 2016 study by medical journal the lancet , estimates suggested that about 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 per cent of the global population are transgender . there is no official estimate of the number of transgender people among singapore s population . healthcare accessibility opened in 2017 , the gender health clinic under the institute of mental health imh is believed to be the only public hospital in singapore to have a team of medical professionals specialised in treating the transgender community , after the gender identity clinic at national university hospital closed in 2008 . transgender patients who wish to seek help from the clinic can get a referral through public hospitals or polyclinics . read also review of singapore s mental healthcare system underway , as mps highlight existing gaps however , transgender sg , an organisation that collates resources for the transgender community in singapore , said that getting this referral is not that straightforward , because many public healthcare workers do not know what to do when a person with gender dysphoria approaches them . this was the case for kaeden lim , 17 , who sought professional medical support from regular psychiatrists at a public hospital when he was 12 due to struggles with gender dysphoria and his mental health . it took more than a year and four psychiatrists before he was finally referred to imh s gender health clinic . today spoke to kaeden s parents , who confirmed that kaeden is a patient at the gender clinic and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2018 . the teenager recalled how even after he had told the doctors that he identifies as a transgender male , they continued to use female pronouns when addressing him . it was only at the imh gender health clinic that kaeden received the support he was looking for when a doctor at the clinic validated his experience as a transgender person . read also decisions on use of hormonal therapy rest with clinicians and their patients moe , imh all three transgender students whom today interviewed said that their experience at the gender clinic was affirming and positive . their frustration , though , lies with having to wait around three months between appointments because there are only a handful of doctors servicing the clinic . when contacted about the issue , imh declined to comment . there are options available for patients to go to a private doctor for medical support , but many choose not to because the prices for private consultations can be up to two to four times higher than public consultations . professor tsoi wing foo , a psychiatrist in private practice who has treated patients with gender dysphoria for 50 years , said that some patients choose to go to him for treatment first while waiting for an appointment in the public hospital , which can take a few months . since 2007 , he has seen 1 , 000 patients with gender dysphoria . most of his patients are between the ages of 18 and 30 . read also gender dysphoria schools can work out practical arrangements with students if there are valid medical grounds , says lawrence wong the young people interviewed by today said what makes matters worse is that information and resources for healthcare support is not easily accessible . for instance , they found out about how to get a referral to the imh gender clinic through a private online community and the information was not available publicly . transgender sg has a list of healthcare providers that cater to transgender people , but it does not make this information public due to fears of societal backlash . lack of social support then , there are some young transgender people who are unable to begin hormone replacement therapy due to lack of support from family . this was the case for lexi not her real name , who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019 . lexi let today see the appointment cards , receipts and correspondence from a hospital showing that she is a patient at the imh gender health clinic and has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria . in singapore , individuals below 21 have to get permission from their parents before they can be referred to an endocrinologist , who specialises in treating conditions related to hormones and hormonal glands . because lexi s parents are against her medically transitioning , the 18 year old has resorted to buying hormone pills off unauthorised websites without a prescription . she relies on the accounts of other transgender women to figure out how much to take . the ngos told today that this is a common occurrence within the community for those who do not have support to transition but are desperate to start the process . doctors are warning that buying and using hormones from websites can be dangerous . dr abel soh , an endocrinologist at mount elizabeth hospital , said that there are many unbranded hormone treatments available online that may not necessarily provide the same concentration of hormones stated . taking hormones without monitoring their levels in the blood via blood tests may potentially result in excessive usage , he said . agreeing , dr ben ng from arden endocrinology specialist clinic said that gender transitioning is a complex and multi pronged process . professional evaluation from a medical doctor is necessary to ensure that the therapy prescribed is appropriate and safe . both specialists said that taking the wrong prescription of hormones could lead to significant health problems , including increased risk of blood clots , heart disease and stroke . even when transgender students have family support , they might feel alienated in school because the institutions often are not equipped to help them , the patients and experts said . for instance , students face hurdles over which uniform they can wear or which toilets they can use . this was the case for junior college student jules not her real name , who started hormone replacement therapy last year . today confirmed with jules parents that she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and is seeing a doctor at the imh gender health clinic . during a disagreement with the school over which uniform she should wear , the 18 year old was asked to wear a lab coat over her physical education attire during science practical class . jules said that this has made her feel more anxious because she now stands out among her peers , who wear either long pants or skirts during these lessons . she has also resorted to drinking as little water as possible and holding her bladder to avoid using the bathroom in school . if i could describe it in one sentence , it s like i m going out with an extremely bad haircut every day just constantly being self

"highlighting how 377a acts as a barrier to reporting , ms anisha said regardless of police or prosecutorial discretion , the possibility of being investigated for a criminal offence ."," but under reporting of sexual abuse remains an issue partly due to legal barriers experts more males are reporting being molested , continuing a rising trend in recent years , though experts flag that under reporting remains an issue for sexual crimes , in part because of legal barriers . last year , 116 males were victims of molestation , about 1 . 5 times the 74 cases in 2010 close to 80 per cent of male victims last year were aged 21 and below . this comes as the total number of molestation victims rose to 1 , 672 last year , from 1 , 511 in 2010 . while a rise in figures could be due to more people committing the crimes , experts pointed to other possible factors like greater awareness of sexual offences and assurances that cases will be treated sensitively . but institute of mental health imh senior clinical psychologist kenny liew noted that under reporting of sexual abuse remains a major issue . this is partly due to legal barriers , said ms anisha joseph , who heads the sexual assault care centre sacc run by the association of women for action and research . rape is narrowly defined under the current penal code where only women can be victims , she said , referring to more serious cases . we hope that this will soon change with the penal code review committee s recent recommendation to make it a gender neutral offence . another barrier is section 377a of the penal code , she told the straits times . the section criminalises any act of gross indecency between men , in public or private . this deters both straight and gay men from making police reports , she said , citing feedback from those who sought help at sacc . survivors may fear being investigated for prior non coercive , consensual acts with either the man they reported , or with other men . the sacc itself has seen a rising number of sexual assault cases involving male victims . in the first half of this year alone , there were 12 cases , compared with 15 for the whole of last year and 13 in 2016 . where the details were known to sacc , close to nine in 10 of the male victims knew the perpetrators , who included relatives and intimate partners . in 80 per cent of these cases , the perpetrators were men . this is consistent with national trends . of the 975 people arrested last year for molestation , all but 11 were males . highlighting how 377a acts as a barrier to reporting , ms anisha said regardless of police or prosecutorial discretion , the possibility of being investigated for a criminal offence . . . can be traumatic . lawyer gregory vijayendran , president of the law society , too , noted that section 377a could be a double edged sword . while it could still serve a salutary purpose to ensure the male perpetrators of sexual abuse are punished . . . it is not inconceivable that a victim may not report due to concerns of being punished for the same offence , he said . male to male sexual abuse also falls within the ambit of section 376 on sexual assault by penetration . the issue comes amid recent discussions on 377a , with attorney general lucien wong saying this month that the government has not removed or restricted prosecutorial discretion for the section . such legal issues add to other deterrents to reporting that sexual assault survivors might face . for example , said mr vijayendran , if the abuser is someone in authority and a respected figure in society , the victim may wonder if he will be believed . for men , there may be another layer involved coming out to their families , friends or employers , who may not know their sexual orientation . with societal stigmatisation that exists in some quarters , this could prove a realistic psycho social barrier to a male victim lodging a police report , said mr vijayendran . ms anisha said survivors may meet with disbelief and victim blaming comments . imh s mr liew said many boys and men may still believe the myths that if he experienced sexual arousal during the abuse , he wanted and or enjoyed it , and thus the abuse was his fault .

no one is suggesting that 21 year olds be able to buy govt housing .,"i am trying to understand your point . no one is suggesting that 21 year olds be able to buy govt housing . my suggestion is that young singles be able to rent them affordably with perhaps with an option to pyrchase at age 35 . singapore is pursuing 2 goals with housing . a allowing family units to purchase affordable housing b in doing so , incentivising people to shack up and increase our tfr . we are somewhat successful at a but a complete failure at b . i honestly that if the govt was able to increase our tfr to 2 . 1 , everyone would be overjoyed and we would die die find a way to build enough hdb s for everyone . we should not assume that hdb supply cannot be appreciably increased . if our supply is already so constrained with our negative population growth , this is a tacit admission something has gone seriously wrong . even if this is true , this is solvable . and it must be solved because not solving it inevitably leads to unaffordability and or social problems regardless of how harshly we try to ration housing . also you sure you are on the right track citing berlin and tokyo as cities with a high cost of housing . berlin is an economic backwater . rent is very affordable there . tokyo s housing market has a vast glut of new construction fuelled by low interest rates , low construction costs and low regulatory barriers to construction . the rest of these countries have awful urban housing prices because their housing situation is driven by a combination of nimby regulatory capture restricting new supply and distorted market pricing . singapore on the other hand has a housing market that is heavily dominated by government policy programs . singaporeans have accepted the negative tradeoffs to get here . for instance , land reform via extensive compulsory government land acquisition , limited freehold , home buying subject to the nanny state . so you are telling me that inspite of giving the government all these policy levers , we must also get fucked with the same problems that some other countries have . if that is the case , we truly have a vast failure of the imagination . honestly , i am not betting on singapore s housing market . we are shutting out immigrants . our population is going to halve with each generation . neighborhood schools are closing and merging . how long can we sustain scarcity even if we don t build ? much better to buy a cheap house somewhere ulu and invest in overseas stocks .

"it s to the point where we end up either trapped in rent or needing to pay a lot for private housing just to have a roof over our heads , which queer people may need more as parents that are also queerphobic are a nightmare to live with .","why is this amendment to the constitution and in some ways , the repeal too fucked up ? well , as a queer person , it s quite simple . they are removing the ability for singaporean citizens to go to the courts to challenge our current government on our constitution . for those that want to be clear , this was the very avenue that is forcing our current government to repeal 377a . the courts let parliament know that they were going to repeal 377a if there was any future court challenges , which is why the pap explained that they are repealing 377a only to reduce the risk of being embarrassed by the courts by being called out by their citizens for harming them . they probably wished they could have done this earlier with 377a . i bet . so instead they will do it with protecting marriage and every other benefit that marriage has , along with it . singaporeans could challenge them through multiple avenues , through ballot boxes , protests , lobbying to mps petitions , and through the courts . but here , specifically for queer singaporeans , they re removing the option that we managed to use to get them to repeal 377a . and as someone who is queer , fuck that . it s specifically targeting and framing us , as queer people , as a threat that needs protecting , even though we guaran fucking tee we don t even want to touch anything on heterosexual marriages . we re seen as somehow worse for society , innately , by who we are . their protection of the heterosexual family being a basic building block that nobody can live without is bullshit . for queer people , the found families we form which also come in many forms beyond the monogamous , beyond the romantic and beyond gender are beautiful and ones we can t live without . what makes heterosexual families , then , worth protecting even more than the queer family ? also remember that every single right that heterosexual couples have who can be married for the rest of their lives is subsequently denied to everyone who is queer let alone single , which stretches to major things like housing , childcare benefits , deathcare and the like . it s not a social issue where feelings gets hurt , it s fucking material . it s to the point where we end up either trapped in rent or needing to pay a lot for private housing just to have a roof over our heads , which queer people may need more as parents that are also queerphobic are a nightmare to live with . lots of heterosexual engaged married couples i know have issues getting a bto , or the long as hell waiting times for them . that hurts , i know . but at least y all can apply now , instead of having to wait around 10 more years of your life before you can even think about applying . and in singapore , where housing also matters a lot in terms of potential retirement value . . . yeah it fucking hurts to live here . so , if anything , remember that the pap don t give a fuck about queer people , giving people a choice , or even about democracy . this repeal , and subsequent amendment to the constitution , is only present to protect themselves from being embarrassed as long as they have power . no longer can we challenge in court on how unequal they are to us , as fellow singaporean citizens . we now have to find new ways to challenge power or build our own . and at the end of the day , to us , it s fucking exhausting . i m tired of having to strategize how to fucking live in this country , to navigate every barrier that gets higher and higher , to avoid being perceived as a threat that somehow needs protection against . and , newsflash , not every queer person has the space , resources or freedom to just move lor . many places feel like hell to queer people , but singapore feels like a special circle of hell . tl dr framing marriage as needing protection against queer ppl frames us as a threat and justifies placing more , tougher barriers against us .

"it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter ."," it is not marriage calling something marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order established by god , one sins and offends god . same sex marriage does just this . accordingly , anyone who professes to love god must be opposed to it . marriage is not the creature of any state . rather , it was established by god in paradise for our first parents , adam and eve . as we read in the book of genesis god created man in his image in the divine image he created him male and female he created them . god blessed them , saying be fertile and multiply fill the earth and subdue it . gen . 1 28 29 the same was taught by our savior jesus christ from the beginning of the creation , god made them male and female . for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife . mark 10 6 7 . genesis also teaches how god punished sodom and gomorrah for the sin of homosexuality the lord rained down sulphurous fire upon sodom and gomorrah . he overthrew those cities and the whole plain , together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil . gen . 19 24 25 ",11-06-2015 10:18,Reddit,same sex marriage,-1

the idea of censoring media that promotes or glamorizes lgbt issues hosts the problem of whether media showing homosexuality as a normal occurrence constitutes as promoting or glamorizing .,"i would like to write about why i think google is doing something that s great for singapore . google has effectively helped several of the problems that lgbt citizens face in singapore the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship , and the lack of resources for grassroots movements in singapore to happen effectively . the transparency of lgbt citizens due to censorship lgbt media in singapore suffers from significant censorship and lgbt citizens have little say in how their life is fairly portrayed in mainstream media . compare and contrast the two different events below in 2006 , brokeback mountain passed completely uncensored into singapore . http news . bbc . co . uk 2 hi entertainment 4716610 . stm however , in 2007 , we have censorship of gay sex scenes in a small local movie festival . http pluralsg . wordpress . com 2007 04 24 gay sex scenes in local movie solos censored although i may stand corrected on the details , the article mentions that more graphic scenes that were not lgbt generally passed uncensored . but the biggest problem i have is with the guidelines on lgbt censorship in singapore . this problem can be seen directly from the bbc article on brokeback mountain singapore s media content director said ang lee s film was passed as it did not promote or glamorise the lifestyle . the idea of censoring media that promotes or glamorizes lgbt issues hosts the problem of whether media showing homosexuality as a normal occurrence constitutes as promoting or glamorizing . for example , the bbc article references that but in 2004 , taiwanese film formula 17 , which was about two teenage boys falling in love , was banned because it portrayed homosexuality as normal , and a natural progression of society . you can see that the reason for censorship is completely different the movie was censored because it showed someone living a normal lgbt life if you could somehow call it that way . and if you seriously consider something innocuous as this as a promotion or glamorization of lgbt lifestyles , then honestly , what exactly can pass the censors for lgbt citizens to get their message across that lgbt citizens are people too ? either way , the directive for censorship is incredibly vague and leaves plenty of room for the censor boards to do whatever they want , or the censor boards are simply being inconsistent with their censoring . these are both troubling conclusions . the lack of resources in grassroots movements in singapore for those in this thread who are worried that google is simply using its corporate clout to lobby the singapore government , the article states that that s not what google is trying to do their strategy involves developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . http dot429 . com articles 2012 07 06 google wants the world to legalize love google s strategy is not so much of lobbying the government directly so much as developing partnerships between companies and organizations to support grass roots campaigns . i find this heartening because i ve attended lgbt support groups in singapore and see that they are sorely lacking on funds to do something impactful . the people who work there are definitely passionate about improving the lives of lgbt singaporeans a key part of oogachaga one of the support groups is to provide support for lgbt singaporeans to re connect with their families because of the fear of being ostracized when coming out . while i think this a great cause to support that appeals to the family first mentality of singaporeans , they don t have quite the funds to extend their reach to most singaporeans . considering the last event i went to had about 25 young adults attend , this is really small when you consider that singapore has more than 4 million citizens . google and barclays were the largest sponsors of pink dot 2012 a grassroots movement that has become very successful , although it s an event where 99 of the participants are lgbt citizens . i went to the last one and although there were supporting families who came , they were few and far between . conclusion overall , i think the move by google and the support provided by citi and ernst young gives me some hope that same sex rights can be established in my generation . i think that progress can happen faster than people think it could the most important step is for citizens to talk about it openly and proponents of same sex rights to not be afraid of backlash to their jobs and familial relationships . google is definitely helping here .

"they believe that the government will make the appropriate decision that will reflect our social situation in singapore indranee rajah in this case , the public reaction has shown that the majority of singaporeans do not agree with or accept homosexual behaviour .","people here in this thread are hammering the sdp over a non issue . no opposition party in singapore will address lgbt issues publicly , even if they support them privately . this is the most practical form of politics given that public support will alienate a huge majority of their support given singapore s largely conservative population , especially among the older generation , when support for them is already hard to come by in the first place . we have to realise that things like this takes time , and it would be unwise for any opposition parties to lose any political capital before they even get elected into parliament . what is the point of anyone coming out and say oh 377a should be repealed , but never get elected into parliament ? as usual , redditors think too highly of themselves if they feel that opposition parties should ignore all practicalities and just support lgbt issues without considering the full political climate of the country . if there is any party you really want to blame , you can thank the incumbent for singapore s current stance against lgbt . they are the party with the most political capital to expend , and can be the only party said to hold on to their bases and not immediately lose power even if they support lgbt . but guess what , they are not going to be doing that anything soon , with a few mps like christopher de souza even coming out publicly to reject lgbt rights . edit for those of you interested , here are what some pap mp said about lgbt rights and issues . you can decide the rest for yourself . christopher de souza the last consequence of a repeal of section 377a is its effect on how we may have to educate our children . it flows that with changes in how marriage , the family nucleus and spousal rights are defined , there will be pressure to change our curricula in our schools . do we want to see our children being taught that homosexuality is an acceptable lifestyle choice ? this is something that we should all think carefully about . zaqy mohamad in my view , the government s status quo stand on homosexual activities under section 377a is for the benefit of society as a whole . the fact is , even though our country is open and receptive to changes and diversity , our society s majority view is still conservative in many aspects of life . . . . . . from a secular point of view , it is something personal and i feel that it is good to leave it as such . but many of my constituents and community leaders have given feedback that by making the activity not considered as an offence , it can be seen as an endorsement or support and this will divide society . they believe that the government will make the appropriate decision that will reflect our social situation in singapore indranee rajah in this case , the public reaction has shown that the majority of singaporeans do not agree with or accept homosexual behaviour . i think it will be fair to say that most singaporeans do not want to see somebody jailed for homosexual practices , but most would definitely not want to see any public demonstration of the conduct . they may be prepared to tolerate it if it is done in private , but they do not wish to see it in public and , very importantly , they do not wish to have their children see it in public . then , of course , the argument comes , ok , fine , if we do not do it in public , what if we just do it in private ? and that is where the signalling concern comes in , because people are concerned about the impact that a repeal of section 377a would send .

if they are heterosexual but they prey on a child of the same gender this is homosexual molestation .,"if you are attracted to females under 40 , but they are also above the age of consent so ages 18 39 you re not a pedophile . if you are attracted to females anywhere from age 9 39 , and you are a man , you are a heterosexual pedophile . if you were a 15 year old man this wouldn t apply to you . pedophilia involves intense sexual arousal to children 13 or younger . to be diagnosed , the person must be at least 16 years old and at least five years older than the child they are attracted to . source https www . ncsby . org content understanding adolescents illegal sexual behavior text pedophilia 20involves 20intense 20sexual 20arousal , professional 20should 20make 20a 20diagnosis . i can answer if the example is 16 though . if a 16 year old finds females that are 10 years old attractive they are a pedophile . if they find males above 16 attractive and females 10 or below attractive they are a pedophile and a homosexual , not bisexual . this is because their true sexuality is an attraction to the same gender . pedophilia would be an independent attraction . if they found both females and males above 16 attractive they would be bisexual . to try to put into simple terms a pedophile has a sexual orientation and an attraction to children . these run separately . a pedophile can either be attracted to children and adults , or only children . if the pedophile is attracted to adults and children , their sexuality is based on what their attraction to the adult ages are . they can feel attraction to the opposite gender adult or the same gender adult . many pedophiles will be attracted to an adult of the opposite gender , so they are heterosexual . if they are heterosexual but they prey on a child of the same gender this is homosexual molestation . this term does not mean the person is homosexual , it means that their pedophilic acts were against a child of the same gender . this is because pedophiles , in many cases , will generally not see a child as boy or girl . they will see them as a child . it is true pedophiles can prefer female or male children , but it is considered it s own category because it can widely differ from their sexuality when it comes to adult attraction . so saying that homosexuals or heterosexuals are more likely to be a pedophile is a moot point because pedophilia runs in a completely separate category from homosexuality , bisexuality and heterosexuality . basically , being a homosexual , bisexual , or a heterosexual doesn t make you any more likely to be a pedophile .

"one argument is based on the view that being transgender is a mental illness , and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service .","since you are too lazy to read the link you yourself sent , i ll copy and paste it here for you there are arguments against the inclusion of transgender people in military service . one argument is based on the view that being transgender is a mental illness , and as such transgender individuals are unfit for service . 1 this argument follows a high incidence of depression and suicide manifest in transgender individuals . this is especially pertinent in individuals who have had sex reassignment surgery and are unsatisfied with the results in such cases severe depression is prevalent . 5 hormone therapy can affect mood and a sense of well being , a factor that counts against inclusion of transgender people and its effect on service capability . 5 besides the well being argument of hormone treatment , complications may arise due to hormone treatments . possible complications arising from estrogen and testosterone therapies include an increased risk of thromboembolic disease , myocardial infarction , breast cancer , fertility problems , stroke , abnormal liver function , renal disease , endometrial cancer , and osteoporosis . 6 any of these could cause significant issues to effective military service , especially when deployed in remote areas or in field training settings . another concern is the cost to treat transgender members in the military . a small portion of transgender soldiers seek medical intervention , yearly 30 to 140 pursue hormone treatment and 25 to 100 have surgical reassignment surgery . it is estimated that a male to female transition can cost between us 7 , 000 and 24 , 000 female to male transition can exceed us 50 , 000 . 7 the defense department s yearly budget for healthcare is 6 billion , the numbers found in the study show the cost to treat service members with gd would fall between 2 . 4 million and 8 . 4 million , that is . 04 to . 14 percent of the military s annual healthcare budget . 8 a further argument is that in order to have an effective , smooth running military , there must be cohesion within the unit . it is argued that transgender individuals would have a negative impact on unit cohesion . the bonds of trust among individual service members are vital . 9 there is a fear that if transgender personnel be allowed to serve openly , morale will be detrimentally affected . but this argument neglects to deal with the question of what kinds of structural accommodations might be needed to maintain morale and unit cohesion in such situations . military service forces members into very intimate living quarters . requiring members to live in situations that make them feel disconcerted and uncomfortable may result in their performance being undermined . 1 6 ",19-01-2021 17:53,Reddit,mental illness,-1
"that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform .","when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021

the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different .," it is not marriage calling something marriage does not make it marriage . marriage has always been a covenant between a man and a woman which is by its nature ordered toward the procreation and education of children and the unity and wellbeing of the spouses . the promoters of same sex marriage propose something entirely different . they propose the union between two men or two women . this denies the self evident biological , physiological , and psychological differences between men and women which find their complementarity in marriage . it also denies the specific primary purpose of marriage the perpetuation of the human race and the raising of children . 2 . it violates natural law marriage is not just any relationship between human beings . it is a relationship rooted in human nature and thus governed by natural law . natural law s most elementary precept is that good is to be done and pursued , and evil is to be avoided . by his natural reason , man can perceive what is morally good or bad for him . thus , he can know the end or purpose of each of his acts and how it is morally wrong to transform the means that help him accomplish an act into the act s purpose . any situation which institutionalizes the circumvention of the purpose of the sexual act violates natural law and the objective norm of morality . being rooted in human nature , natural law is universal and immutable . it applies to the entire human race , equally . it commands and forbids consistently , everywhere and always . saint paul taught in the epistle to the romans that the natural law is inscribed on the heart of every man . rom . 2 14 15 3 . it always denies a child either a father or a mother it is in the child s best interests that he be raised under the influence of his natural father and mother . this rule is confirmed by the evident difficulties faced by the many children who are orphans or are raised by a single parent , a relative , or a foster parent . the unfortunate situation of these children will be the norm for all children of a same sex marriage . a child of a same sex marriage will always be deprived of either his natural mother or father . he will necessarily be raised by one party who has no blood relationship with him . he will always be deprived of either a mother or a father role model . same sex marriage ignores a child s best interests . 4 . it validates and promotes the homosexual lifestyle in the name of the family , same sex marriage serves to validate not only such unions but the whole homosexual lifestyle in all its bisexual and transgender variants . civil laws are structuring principles of man s life in society . as such , they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior . they externally shape the life of society , but also profoundly modify everyone s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior . legal recognition of same sex marriage would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values , devalue traditional marriage , and weaken public morality . 5 . it turns a moral wrong into a civil right homosexual activists argue that same sex marriage is a civil rights issue similar to the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s . this is false . first of all , sexual behavior and race are essentially different realities . a man and a woman wanting to marry may be different in their characteristics one may be black , the other white one rich , the other poor or one tall , the other short . none of these differences are insurmountable obstacles to marriage . the two individuals are still man and woman , and thus the requirements of nature are respected . same sex marriage opposes nature . two individuals of the same sex , regardless of their race , wealth , stature , erudition or fame , will never be able to marry because of an insurmountable biological impossibility . secondly , inherited and unchangeable racial traits cannot be compared with non genetic and changeable behavior . there is simply no analogy between the interracial marriage of a man and a woman and the marriage between two individuals of the same sex . 6 . it does not create a family but a naturally sterile union traditional marriage is usually so fecund that those who would frustrate its end must do violence to nature to prevent the birth of children by using contraception . it naturally tends to create families . on the contrary , same sex marriage is intrinsically sterile . if the spouses want a child , they must circumvent nature by costly and artificial means or employ surrogates . the natural tendency of such a union is not to create families . therefore , we cannot call a same sex union marriage and give it the benefits of true marriage . 7 . it defeats the state s purpose of benefiting marriage one of the main reasons why the state bestows numerous benefits on marriage is that by its very nature and design , marriage provides the normal conditions for a stable , affectionate , and moral atmosphere that is beneficial to the upbringing of children all fruit of the mutual affection of the parents . this aids in perpetuating the nation and strengthening society , an evident interest of the state . homosexual marriage does not provide such conditions . its primary purpose , objectively speaking , is the personal gratification of two individuals whose union is sterile by nature . it is not entitled , therefore , to the protection the state extends to true marriage . 8 . it imposes its acceptance on all society by legalizing same sex marriage , the state becomes its official and active promoter . the state calls on public officials to officiate at the new civil ceremony , orders public schools to teach its acceptability to children , and punishes any state employee who expresses disapproval . in the private sphere , objecting parents will see their children exposed more than ever to this new morality , businesses offering wedding services will be forced to provide them for same sex unions , and rental property owners will have to agree to accept same sex couples as tenants . in every situation where marriage affects society , the state will expect christians and all people of good will to betray their consciences by condoning , through silence or act , an attack on the natural order and christian morality . 9 . it is the cutting edge of the sexual revolution in the 1960s , society was pressured to accept all kinds of immoral sexual relationships between men and women . today we are seeing a new sexual revolution where society is being asked to accept sodomy and same sex marriage . if homosexual marriage is universally accepted as the present step in sexual freedom , what logical arguments can be used to stop the next steps of incest , pedophilia , bestiality , and other forms of unnatural behavior ? indeed , radical elements of certain avant garde subcultures are already advocating such aberrations . the railroading of same sex marriage on the american people makes increasingly clear what homosexual activist paul varnell wrote in the chicago free press the gay movement , whether we acknowledge it or not , is not a civil rights movement , not even a sexual liberation movement , but a moral revolution aimed at changing people s view of homosexuality . 10 . it offends god this is the most important reason . whenever one violates the natural moral order established by god , one sins and offends god . same sex marriage does just this . accordingly , anyone who professes to love god must be opposed to it . marriage is not the creature of any state . rather , it was established by god in paradise for our first parents , adam and eve . as we read in the book of genesis god created man in his image in the divine image he created him male and female he created them . god blessed them , saying be fertile and multiply fill the earth and subdue it . gen . 1 28 29 the same was taught by our savior jesus christ from the beginning of the creation , god made them male and female . for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife . mark 10 6 7 . genesis also teaches how god punished sodom and gomorrah for the sin of homosexuality the lord rained down sulphurous fire upon sodom and gomorrah . he overthrew those cities and the whole plain , together with the inhabitants of the cities and the produce of the soil . gen . 19 24 25 ",11-06-2015 10:18,Reddit,same sex

"so the average trans youth here has no choice but to go through the permanent changes of a puberty they do not want , before they re allowed to go on hrt and have surgery to partially reverse those changes .","it depends on when they transition . hrt isn t as regulated in thailand , so young trans girls find it easier to get hormones on the black market before they re too far into male puberty , and thus may never develop the things you mention . in angmoh countries , for trans kids who come out young and maintain a consistent gender identity with body dysphoria , there s also the possibility of puberty blockers for 1 3 years , followed by cross sex hrt , which makes them phenotypically identical to that sex including skeletal structure just infertile . in singapore , that s much harder puberty blockers are not available , and the minimum age for hrt is either 21 or 18 with both parents consent . it used to be 16 , but it got raised after the ashlee saga , probably so schools wouldn t have to bother figuring out how to accommodate trans students . so the average trans youth here has no choice but to go through the permanent changes of a puberty they do not want , before they re allowed to go on hrt and have surgery to partially reverse those changes .

"in 2018 , india s highest court unanimously struck down part of section 377 of the indian penal code , which outlaws same sex relations , following 17 years of legal challenges mounted by activists ."," cna explains the history of 377a and how some countries have repealed it when was 377a introduced and why ? section 377a was introduced to singapore s penal code in the middle of 1938 when it was under british rule . it reads any male person who , in public or private , commits , or abets the commission of , or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of , any act of gross indecency with another male person , shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years . the law was generally believed to have derived from the british government s desire to safeguard public morality by prohibiting homosexual activity in the straits settlements . however , documents from the british national archives that were declassified in 2014 and 2016 reveal that section 377a was originally intended to curtail the spread of male prostitution , and not consensual private sexual acts between men . these were brought to light in 2019 by a legal team that sought to repeal the law . the documents showed that male prostitution was a widespread problem in the area at the time , especially among british civil servants . this eventually led section 377a to be passed in the legislative council of the straits settlements , and was later inherited by singapore . however , the origins of section 377a stretch back to 1860 , when it was first codified as section 377 in the indian penal code by the british empire as carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animal . it was then exported to at least 39 british colonies across asia , the pacific islands and africa . penalties range from two to 20 years in prison but in places that have also implemented sharia law , lgbt people can also face more severe punishment such as flogging . which countries have repealed the law , and which have not ? former british colonies that have repealed the legislation include india , seychelles and fiji . in 2018 , india s highest court unanimously struck down part of section 377 of the indian penal code , which outlaws same sex relations , following 17 years of legal challenges mounted by activists . in the landmark judgment , india s supreme court ruled that it was unconstitutional in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex . criminalising carnal intercourse under section 377 of the indian penal code is irrational , indefensible and manifestly arbitrary , said then chief justice dipak misra in his delivery of the unanimous verdict on sep 6 , 2018 . evolving social attitudes towards lgbt issues have also been attributed to the repealing of 377 . in 2011 , india included a third gender category in addition to the male and female options in its census forms for the first time . bhutan decriminalised homosexuality last year , making it legal to have gay sex and easing restrictions on same sex relationships . the move by the majority buddhist nation of 800 , 000 people came after other asian countries including india and nepal relaxed restrictions on the rights of lgbt people . according to researchers , much of bhutan s penal code was adopted from us laws . however , there are parts about sodomy and unnatural sex , which appear to be identical to language in other penal codes around south asia that was copied from the indian penal code . besides singapore , former british colonies where 377 continues to exist in various forms include malaysia , brunei , pakistan , bangladesh , sri lanka and myanmar . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",19-08-2022 17:12,Reddit,same sex,1

and how do you express sexual preference in a world where gender non binary prevails ?,"gay and lesbian issues are mostly an acceptance issue . if you think about it , they don t really affect much in society which is why it is absurd to exclude them into our society . trans queer issues on the other hand do affect other groups of people . plus the issues that comes with trans acceptance is that it also makes it complicated to come up with rules to help them examples , do you allow mtf to partake in women s sport ? would they ultimately displace biological women in sport ? isn t women s sport exclusive by nature ? contact sport in this case would be incredibly dangerous to women . and how do you express sexual preference in a world where gender non binary prevails ? does this not hurt the gay and lesbian message ? if trans issues become widely accepted , do pre transition trans kids get to take hormone blockers or testosterone enhancers ? if yes how young is too young ? 8 10 16 17 18 21 ? at the very least , they need to figure this out if a do you send mtf to male prisons or to female prisons ? do you cane a ftm person for rape ? do mtf serve ns , do ftm serve ns ? can my mtf daughter go to acs i ? queers issues , i am a male who identify as a female can i study at mgs ? i am just throwing this out there but don t you see the real world consequences of blind acceptance in this case , it is not that easy .

"in cases of severe gender dysphoria , and or where regret is unlikely such as if they ve been living happily as that gender since childhood like jazz jennings , hrt may begin at younger ages on a case by case basis ."," because as it stands in the west right now , there transgender cases keep coming at us younger and younger . yeah . i think it s an improvement , because it means that such kids feel safe to say so at that age . from personal experience as a trans guy , i was already struggling with dysphoria from my first year at kindergarten so age 3 or 4 . i didn t have the words for it then , other than that being a girl or treated as one felt fundamentally wrong and i didn t know why . but even by that age i was aware that it was not something it was ok to say christian family , even though i cried about it a lot and my parents didn t know what was wrong . for the most part i could ignore it though , until puberty , when that sense of wrongness went into overdrive and just kept getting worse and worse until i finally caved and transitioned . i m definitely not alone when it comes to trans adults who had similar feelings from very young ages . usually around kindergarten when they first started being aware that there were boys and girls , and that the one they were supposed to be just felt wrong . in a more liberal environment , it s possible some of us would have said so at that age . social psychologist dr david canter said no one should be assigned the label transgender before puberty . if the child is unhappy then the reasons should be explored without assigning labels . i fully agree with this . though this is also before puberty . once puberty hits , for many trans people the wrong body feeling either begins or starts greatly intensifying and is very unlikely to reverse . i d say never , but there may be exceptions . those are usually the ones who start seeking medical intervention and are very unlikely to regret it . the few such regret cases i know of changed their minds for religious political reasons . for others who don t experience that distress , they might benefit from waiting until they re older and more sure . they may also realise that they re trans but don t feel dysphoric over their bodies . and if medical professionals are preaching caution and advocating for age 18 , i m inclined to believe them . for hrt , the advised age is 16 . 18 or 21 for any sex reassignment surgery depending on country and procedure . puberty blockers are used for those under 16 who are assessed to be suitable for treatment , or where the youth wants more time to be sure before committing to either male or female puberty . in cases of severe gender dysphoria , and or where regret is unlikely such as if they ve been living happily as that gender since childhood like jazz jennings , hrt may begin at younger ages on a case by case basis . from reading doctor s responses from other articles it always gives me the impression they re preaching caution , but are careful not to commit to a full no , or they are unwilling to talk about this issue unfiltered . possibly the latter for some , but the cautious approach is the official stance from medical authorities like the apa . they advise a step by step approach and not pressuring the child into one identity or another , as well as acting on a harm reduction basis . i . e . if a child is constantly crying and extremely distressed about not being allowed to do feminine things , then let them do feminine things and see if that helps . it doesn t mean they re a trans girl . but neither should the parents insist that they act like a boy and force them to do masculine activities . likewise if the kid prefers wearing dresses , or having long hair , or being called by a female name . maybe it s a phase they ll eventually grow out of , or he s just a feminine guy , or maybe she ll turn out to be a trans girl when puberty comes around . it doesn t mean letting them do anything they want , but rather not unnecessarily forcing gender norms on a kid when that s clearly causing them psychological harm , and remaining open to the possibilities that the kid might or might not be trans . let s just say assuming we discover transgenderism is a biological phenomenon in the future there s actually robust scientific support for that , much more than sexual orientation . at this point we re sure that biology definitely plays some part , and it s just a question of how much . we still need to acknowledge the power of the environment , which is what many liberal , virtue signaling parents are doing to their children right now . perhaps , but definitely not in singapore . i generally don t like using the west as an example for social things because our cultures and laws are very different . for example , singaporeans are much more obedient and don t dare to cause trouble by suing people or starting protests , even when we re upset , and the same applies to those of us who are trans . even overseas , i do think that stereotype is not truly reflective of reality .

several legal challenges against 377a have been heard in the courts over the years .," mediacorp apologises for tv drama containing negative gay stereotypes singapore national broadcaster mediacorp has apologised for a tv drama containing negative stereotypes of gay people following a backlash from its viewers and the lgbtq community . in response to social media posts criticising channel 8 drama my guardian angels , mediacorp said in a statement that it had no intention to disrespect or discriminate against any persons or community in the drama . we are sorry if we have offended anyone or caused any distress . we have heard your feedback and will continue to exercise vigilance and be more mindful in our portrayal of characters , said mediacorp . yahoo lifestyle sea first reported about netizens criticism of channel 8 and mediacorp regarding the chinese language drama on 3 july . the show features characters displaying homophobic behaviour , and a male paedophilic character who has a sexually transmitted disease . mediacorp s apology follows an earlier one from actor chase tan , who played the paedophilic character . tan apologised for causing distress to the lgbtq community because of the character . see tan s full apology here . singapore s broadcasting rules do not allow content that has positive portrayals of lgbtq people or promotes homosexual lifestyles . the furore over the tv show began two weeks ago after gay business owner teo yu sheng posted comments criticising the drama on the instagram account of his queer brand , heckin unicorn . teo , 29 , highlighted storylines and scenes in my guardian angels , which he said promote false negative perceptions of the lgbtq community . one character , a basketball coach played by chase tan , molests a teenage boy in one of the scenes . in a separate scene , another boy is shown as having sores , indicating that he is infected with a sexually transmitted disease by the coach . in other scenes , characters played by kym ng and brandon wong behave in a homophobic manner . the two actors play a couple in my guardian angels . the 30 episode series , aired on channel 8 in april and may , is still available for viewing on youtube and mediacorp s streaming service , mewatch . the show also stars zoe tay , pierre png , hong ling , chen tianwen , jin yin ji , benjamin tan , edwin goh and fang rong . criticisms of the show s homophobic scenes spread on various social media platforms , including instagram , twitter and reddit . netizens have written numerous comments in the instagram accounts of mediacorp and channel 8 , calling for the company to apologise for causing harm and distress to the lgbtq community . chase tan and fellow actors kym ng and brandon wong were singled out by netizens for their roles in the tv series , which perpetuate negative perceptions of lgbtq people such as gay men being sexual predators . they also pointed out that such depictions of queer people are not balanced by positive portrayals in local media . advocacy group action for aids afa also criticised mediacorp in a statement last week , saying that the tv series perpetuates false stereotypes about gay people , which create further suffering among an already marginalised and stigmatised population . afa said there is no evidence that homosexual males have a greater propensity to offend against children than heterosexual males , and sexually transmitted diseases can affect anyone and are not confined to any gender identity , sexual orientation or behaviour . commenting on mediacorp s apology , teo said , i m glad that mediacorp has finally mustered the courage to apologise , though it s disappointing that it took them so long to do so . but an apology also isn t enough i hope that mediacorp can pledge to stop creating negative portrayals of the lgbtq community from now onwards . taking real action is the only true form of apology . an afa spokesperson told yahoo lifestyle sea , the apology from mediacorp is a good start . however , what action for aids would like to see is mediacorp taking their role as a credible , national broadcaster seriously and this needs to include being able to have programming that does not set out to demonise any community in singapore . activists have said lgbtq people in singapore suffer persistent discrimination and stigma . sex between men is illegal under section 377a of the penal code . the authorities have said the law is not actively enforced but is still in place to reflect the moral views of the conservative majority . several

your rights do not supersede everyone else s .," so , by that logic , should we get all restaurants to be halal so that muslims can eat wherever they want ? this is not an equal comparison . in your example , not all restaurants are equipped to serve halal food . a better comparison is should restaurants be allowed to refuse service to muslims to which the obvious answer is no . forcing all restaurants to have halal food is not the same as asking restaurants to treat all customers equally . you know that . also , you never answered my question should businesses be allowed to refuse service based on skin color or gender ? if service is denied , you can always go some place else . no need to push your own belief system on others . how do you not see the irony of this ? lgbt people have no choice in being that way , and you are quite literally forcing your belief onto them . what happens when the only store in town refuses you service ? you must go to the next town ? it is ridiculous that you expect lgbt people to have to endure life at the whim of bigots . it is pretty easy to say this when you never have to worry about experiencing it yourself . i do not have much against lgbt as humans , but i have something against them attacking or potentially attacking my own rights and beliefs . no , you want lgbt people to be second class citizens . that is reprehensible . wanting to be treated as an equal human being is not an attack on your rights . your rights do not supersede everyone else s .

"but some trans people are sex predators , same as any other group of people , and crimes happen and people get hurt .","i think it s not so much about the approval process as the social context this is singapore , where a lot of people know each other . coming out as gay , let alone trans , is a big thing that can and often does ruin relationships for good . trans people get kicked out of their homes , disowned by parents , banned from their churches , lose their friends , find trouble getting employed . even if there were no barriers to making that legal intent to transition , few if any people would willingly take all that risk if they weren t actually trans . it s all the more so if they were just a sex predator , because it would just be shooting themselves in both feet . it would be so much easier for them to get away with assaulting someone if they continued presenting as an upstanding member of society with good grades and a bright future . i think it would be crucial if the op is enforceable by law if the intent was issued that would make things worse , tbh . the government shouldn t have the authority to force people to go for surgeries . it s an extremely expensive , major surgery that people can die from , and in the case of trans men it s at least 3 surgeries done over the course of a few years . other than the cost , it means taking months off work , which few people can afford , plus dealing with a lot of pain , needing to find someone to look after them during recovery , as well as the possibility of disatisfying surgical outcomes and medical complications . a trans friend s doctor won t let him go for anymore surgeries unless it s a life or death situation , because his pre existing health conditions mean he might not survive . i read up on the spa case https en . wikipedia . org wiki wi spa controversy and honestly it s a mess . it does seem that the individual in question was a trans woman , not just pretending , and also previously convicted of indecent exposure . however , some of the people who reported her also did so out of transphobic motives . but some trans people are sex predators , same as any other group of people , and crimes happen and people get hurt . we do all we can to prevent that without harming entire minority communities by restricting their full participation in public society . its not they dont care its they have to put an inmate in the gender prison wing they identify as . it s usually because putting trans women in male prisons results in a lot of rape and occasional murder one trans woman in an australian male prison said she was gangraped every day for years , and that s tragically how many of them end up . putting them in female prisons for non violent crimes is the humane alternative , where sex predators and violent offenders are usually locked in solitary confinement regardless of gender . but things are also very different in those countries and their prisons . changi prison isn t the same , and iirc they currently have a separate section for trans prisoners , most of whom are there for non violent crimes such as illegal prostitution or drug offences .

"gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children .","when a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms , is it a case of america s culture war over lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender and queer lgbtq issues being imported into singapore ? or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about ? perhaps a mix of both ? depending on where your sympathies lie , one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you . in january , ashlee , a teenage transgender girl in junior college , complained in an online post that the ministry of education moe had intervened with her treatment , preventing her from obtaining a doctor s referral letter to begin hormone therapy . the post went viral , attracting much debate over gender identity issues and moe s policies when dealing with trans students . days later , a group of five individuals protested against moe s handling of the case outside its building in buona vista . three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit . when the issue was raised in parliament on feb 1 , education minister lawrence wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student , parents and doctors , and moe did not have purview over them . he expressed concern that gender identity issues have become bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some western countries and societies . he added we should not import these culture wars into singapore , or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society . cultural imports ? indeed , in the united states and britain , fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports , military service and gender segregated spaces like bathrooms . but it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in singapore , they are considered on their own merit , and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas . mr wong s cautionary note about culture wars points to lgbtq issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division . if we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues , we will need to engage in more discussion , not less . treating such issues as taboo , for fear of stoking division , may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed . it could also push the discussion towards extreme views , as moderate singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation . after all , the lgbtq , and especially transgender , community has some legitimate concerns , and we can start by acknowledging them , even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns . in any case , it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the west . in many ways , singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people s experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare . from the 1950s to the 1980s , bugis street was famous some would say , infamous for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community . by coincidence , the bugis people of indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender , with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture . singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery . the late professor s . s . ratnam , former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the national university of singapore , did pioneering work in the field . the anguish of gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles . this is well recognised as a medical condition . in fact , the institute of mental health , a public healthcare institution , has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues . hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria . upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery , trans singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents , and marry those of the opposite legal sex . the law allowing this was passed in 1973 . it would be fair to say that trans singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not . but there are gaps . one cost . less well off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change . and while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own , younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency , especially if their parents are unsupportive . two support in school . unlike in some other countries , moe does not appear to have a standardised guideline , procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students . recognising that the issues are complex , and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents , we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion , mr wong told parliament . this may be because there is no consensus among singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear , and moe may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving . schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria , leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students sense of well being . principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms , hair and bathroom usage according to the student s legal sex . they may take disciplinary action against the student for rule breaking , if say , a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long . for those who don t understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms , just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with . if you are a man , imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day . that is more or less what a trans boy would feel he identifies as male , but is made to wear a girl s uniform . gabriel not his real name is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in september 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys uniform . he even sought help from then education minister ong ye kung . by that point , he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment , which masculinised his features and deepened his voice . he told me that during orientation , his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school . but the school insisted he wear the girls uniform . he was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys uniform . over the next month , as term started in earnest , gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate . with no sign of a resolution in sight , he soon dropped out . he spent the next year with his parents support undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex . after finally collecting his new nric earlier this year , he enrolled again in a different jc . all of that just to be allowed to wear pants . some may ask what is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like ? why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like gabriel ? such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria . the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , published by the american psychiatric association , recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social , occupational , school or other important areas of functioning and can be worsened by peer ostracism . telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the a levels . gabriel s experience , and the more recent incident involving ashlee , both raise legitimate questions about medical issues , such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty , hormone therapy or surgery , as well as social issues , such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children . to avoid a culture war , these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith . rather than being freely given everything they think they want , what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults parents , teachers , doctors , policymakers and the public . if trans youth are properly counselled , guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs , they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self administering hormone medication purchased online , or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of jc , or indeed , to write angry public posts online . they will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves . that , surely , is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over . rei kurohi",07-03-2021 19:59,Reddit,trans,0

also i havent encounter any early church fathers writing that kinda approve healthy homosexual relationship it s not likely that any of them did .,"my beliefs on homosexuality were previously the same as yours . i changed it as a result of years of research and debating others , rather than from trying to find evidence to support an existing view . so i dont see any debates about this can be fruitful . we don t have to look just at the text itself . jesus said we can know things by their fruit . the traditional teaching on homosexuality has led to a lot of bad fruit , and that is reason to question it . also i havent encounter any early church fathers writing that kinda approve healthy homosexual relationship it s not likely that any of them did . most gay sex back then involved male soldiers raping their defeated enemies or young boys sold as sex slaves , so it would be more worrying if they weren t against that . there was no notion of a healthy homosexual relationship . most heterosexual relationships weren t that healthy either , especially in a society where women were seen as property and marriage had more to do with money and politics than love . before the 19th century , there was no widespread concept of someone who might be naturally inclined towards the same sex . the assumption was that everyone was attracted to the opposite sex , but some people decided to have gay sex because their lusts were particularly perverse or extreme . criticising that and calling for healthy sexual moderation e . g . within marriage is completely different from denying gay people any form of sexual expression whatsoever . for me personally the calling of someone with homosexual attraction is to be celibate . in his book god and the gay christian , matthew vines wrote that while grappling with the morality of homosexuality was fairly new in christian theology , celibacy was something that had been studied and debated in depth from early christian history . it was the consenus of theologians over the centuries that forced celibacy was unbiblical and spiritually destructive , and to enforce that on anyone would be morally wrong . celibacy is given to some as a gift . it is not and was never meant to be the default for any group of people . in that sense , requiring celibacy for gay people would actually be going against more of christian tradition than allowing gay marriage would be , even though that may seem counterintuitive . for another slightly different take , the late christian theologian and ethicist lewis b . smedes wrote this essay like the wideness of the sea http www . archives . soulforce . org 1998 01 01 like the wideness of the sea in 1998 , which was seminal in the discussion of lgbt inclusion within the christian church . he argues that while same sex unions may not have been part of god s original design , they are the best and most moral option for gay christians in a broken world , and god s grace covers them as well .

whoqol 100 before and after sex reassignment surgery in brazilian male to female transsexual individuals .,"ah okay ! thanks for clarifying . quick personal answers the effects of gender dysphoria are most pronounced in social settings . being able to pass for the gender you identify with firstly means you re less likely to be subject to distressing comments , people are less likely to be prejudiced toward you because they don t know you are trans , etc . so that s one reason off the top of my head why transitioning helps the mental health of trans people . and yes , transitioning is extremely expensive . iirc , top surgery for trans men costs at least 10k . not sure about trans women . bottom surgery can go up to at least 100k for both men women . not to mention the time you ll have to take off of work for recovery , and the subsequent lost income from this time off . from what i know , regular shots for hrt hormonal replacement therapy , which is lifetime , would be 10 a week under public healthcare . transitioning legally for trans men would additionally require them to undergo a hysterectomy removal of uterus and subsequently give up their reproductive capacities . i m not very familiar with what s required for trans women to change their gender marker . these are some journals you can read up on that have researched the benefits of transitioning , and the effects of transitioning on trans people . 1 wierckx k , van caenegem e , elaut e , dedecker d , van de peer f , toye k , weyers s , hoebeke p , monstrey s , de cuypere g , t sjoen g . quality of life and sexual health after sex reassignment surgery in transsexual men . j sex med . 2011 dec 8 12 3379 88 . doi 10 . 1111 j . 1743 6109 . 2011 . 02348 . x . epub 2011 jun 23 . pmid 21699661 . 2 ainsworth ta , spiegel jh . quality of life of individuals with and without facial feminization surgery or gender reassignment surgery . qual life res . 2010 sep 19 7 1019 24 . doi 10 . 1007 s11136 010 9668 7 . epub 2010 may 12 . pmid 20461468 . 3 bailey , l . , ellis , s . j . , mcneil , j . 2014 . suicide risk in the uk trans population and the role of gender transition in decreasing suicidal ideation and suicide attempt . mental health review journal , 19 4 , 209 220 . https doi . org 10 . 1108 mhrj 05 2014 0015 4 stacey l . colton meier ma , kara m . fitzgerald ma , seth t . pardo ma julia babcock phd 2011 the effects of hormonal gender affirmation treatment on mental health in female to male transsexuals , journal of gay lesbian mental health , 15 3 , 281 299 , doi 10 . 1080 19359705 . 2011 . 581195 5 cardoso da silva , d . , schwarz , k . , fontanari , a . m . v . , costa , a . b . , massuda , r . , henriques , a . a . , salvador , j . , silveira , e . , elias rosito , t . , lobato , m . i . r . 2016 . whoqol 100 before and after sex reassignment surgery in brazilian male to female transsexual individuals . the journal of sexual medicine , 13 6 , 988 993 . https doi . org 10 . 1016 j . jsxm . 2016 . 03 . 370 6 castellano e , crespi c , dell aquila c , rosato r , catalano c , mineccia v , motta g , botto e , manieri c . quality of life and hormones after sex reassignment surgery . j endocrinol invest . 2015 dec 38 12 1373 81 . doi 10 . 1007 s40618 015 0398 0 . pmid 26486135 . 7 papadopulos na , lell jd , zavlin d , herschbach p , henrich g , kovacs l , ehrenberger b , kluger ak , machens hg , schaff j . quality of life and patient satisfaction following male to female sex reassignment surgery . j sex med . 2017 may 14 5 721 730 . doi 10 . 1016 j . jsxm . 2017 . 01 . 022 . epub 2017 mar 31 . pmid 28366591 . honestly , there are many many many more journals . but here are a few .

my beliefs on homosexuality were previously the same as yours .,"my beliefs on homosexuality were previously the same as yours . i changed it as a result of years of research and debating others , rather than from trying to find evidence to support an existing view . so i dont see any debates about this can be fruitful . we don t have to look just at the text itself . jesus said we can know things by their fruit . the traditional teaching on homosexuality has led to a lot of bad fruit , and that is reason to question it . also i havent encounter any early church fathers writing that kinda approve healthy homosexual relationship it s not likely that any of them did . most gay sex back then involved male soldiers raping their defeated enemies or young boys sold as sex slaves , so it would be more worrying if they weren t against that . there was no notion of a healthy homosexual relationship . most heterosexual relationships weren t that healthy either , especially in a society where women were seen as property and marriage had more to do with money and politics than love . before the 19th century , there was no widespread concept of someone who might be naturally inclined towards the same sex . the assumption was that everyone was attracted to the opposite sex , but some people decided to have gay sex because their lusts were particularly perverse or extreme . criticising that and calling for healthy sexual moderation e . g . within marriage is completely different from denying gay people any form of sexual expression whatsoever . for me personally the calling of someone with homosexual attraction is to be celibate . in his book god and the gay christian , matthew vines wrote that while grappling with the morality of homosexuality was fairly new in christian theology , celibacy was something that had been studied and debated in depth from early christian history . it was the consenus of theologians over the centuries that forced celibacy was unbiblical and spiritually destructive , and to enforce that on anyone would be morally wrong . celibacy is given to some as a gift . it is not and was never meant to be the default for any group of people . in that sense , requiring celibacy for gay people would actually be going against more of christian tradition than allowing gay marriage would be , even though that may seem counterintuitive . for another slightly different take , the late christian theologian and ethicist lewis b . smedes wrote this essay like the wideness of the sea http www . archives . soulforce . org 1998 01 01 like the wideness of the sea in 1998 , which was seminal in the discussion of lgbt inclusion within the christian church . he argues that while same sex unions may not have been part of god s original design , they are the best and most moral option for gay christians in a broken world , and god s grace covers them as well .

"many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men ."," government considering best way forward on 377a , will respect different viewpoints shanmugam court s decision consistent with past position on 377a mr shanmugam noted that successive court judgments over the years have consistently taken the position that these are highly contentious social issues and within the province of parliament . the heterosexual stable family remains a stable norm , he added . the current legal position reflects our society s norms , values and attitudes . that s what the courts have said . in its judgment , the court noted that the compromise which singapore has struck , in respect to section 377a , is unique , said mr shanmugam . our approach strikes a balance between preserving the legislative status quo , whilst accommodating the concerns of those directly affected by the legislation . the court recognised that the government did this in order to avoid driving a deeper wedge within our society , he added . it also noted that singapore s approach seeks to keep what to do with section 377a within the democratic space . socially charged issues , such as section 377a , call for continued discussion and open ended resolution within the political domain , where we can forge consensus , rather than in win lose outcomes in court . in this way , we can accommodate divergent interests , avoid polarisation and facilitate incremental change , said mr shanmugam . additionally , the court highlighted the importance of creating space for peaceful co existence among various groups , especially since the balance between the various interests around section 377a has grown more delicate . these opinions align with the approach that the government has taken in dealing with section 377a , and that it intends to take as it considers the changes in our social landscape since 2007 . in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong said in parliament , when the penal code was amended but section 377a left unchanged , that we want to be a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society , said mr shanmugam . mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin . this remains our stand today , added mr shanmugam . our emphases on gradual evolution and on traditional families remain constant . shifting attitudes towards homosexuality however , since the issue was last discussed in parliament in 2007 , social attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted , mr shanmugam acknowledged . one of the things that upsets the lgbt community is that many feel that their experience of being hurt or rejected by their families , friends , schools , companies is not recognised , indeed often denied . at the same time , a large majority want to preserve the overall tone of our society , said mr shanmugam . in particular , the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman , and that children should be raised within such a family structure . their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family . many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men . both these viewpoints are valid and important , he added . live and let live approach noting that these are deeply divisive issues , mr shanmugam said that is why the government takes a live and let live approach . we seek to be an inclusive society , where mutual respect and tolerance for different views and practices are paramount . government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement . and agc takes a similar approach . mr shanmugam added that the government had expressly included in the mrha maintenance of religious harmony act that any attack on lgbt groups , or on persons because they are lgbt , will be an offence , and won t be tolerated . lgbt individuals are entitled to live peacefully , without being attacked or threatened , he said . likewise , any attack on any other group , based on their religion , or religious beliefs , even if those beliefs run counter to values held by lgbt groups will not be acceptable . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",03-03-2022 16:08,Reddit,homosexual,1

"statistically , the vast majority of children are not likely to be trans , which is why we don t but likewise , a child who fulfills the diagnostic criteria and has passed multiple assessments is statistically very likely to be trans , and treatment thus errs on the side of caution .","it helps to look into why those adults regretted it , though . for example , misdiagnosis is more common for adults because they undergo much more lenient assessment often a one off diagnosis by one or two psychs , vs children who need to be assessed by a whole team of doctors and psychiatrists before social transition , are monitored throughout , and then have to go for another round of assessments before beginning puberty blockers , with continued monitoring . this provides more failsafes than it does for adults , who could just find a less rigorous doctor willing to approve them for treatment if they pay enough money . there s also how many of those adults transitioned a decade or more ago , when both doctors and patients were much less informed on trans issues and more prone to making misdiagnoses . regarding regret in particular , many reasons cited often had to do with dissatisfactory surgical results or health complications which thus concerned surgery and not transition in general , which have significantly improved over the years since the 1960s when those first patients were tracked , or from not being able to visually blend in with other people of their gender , which is a complete non issue for those who transition at puberty . another large source of regret was the abuse they received from family , friends and society after transition , such as being fired from their jobs and kicked out of their homes and made to resort to sex work to survive the regret thus came from deciding they would have rather tolerated living with dysphoria than have to live life that way . almost all of these problems do not exist for those who transition at puberty , who by necessity have supportive family , and who never develop the secondary sexual characteristics that would otherwise require additional surgery or make it difficult for them to look like others in their gender . more than that , as a society we do already trust children and young teenagers to know their gender . if we didn t , we would be mandating puberty blockers for everyone in case they turned out to be transgender and deeply regret going through the wrong puberty . statistically , the vast majority of children are not likely to be trans , which is why we don t but likewise , a child who fulfills the diagnostic criteria and has passed multiple assessments is statistically very likely to be trans , and treatment thus errs on the side of caution . re walt heyer he previously said so in his own words that he was not actually trans , and used to frame his story as a case of medical malpractice and misdiagnosis . that framing has since changed to present himself as a trans person who regretted transition .

so why should sexual orientation not be one of these aspects ?,"to me it s about treating everyone equally . the past 50 and more years have been about fostering cohesion between people with differences in race , language , and religion . sexual orientation , much like race , is not something to be chosen . heck , if i could , why would i not select the option that would make life easiest for me ? why would i want to live a life of discrimination and unorthodoxy ? so why should someone who has no power over this characteristic have to be disadvantaged or suffer for it ? because i am no less human and no less incapable of empathy and productivity than the next man in line . besides , the argument that children being exposed to homosexuality as a lifestyle is complete bollocks . no properly straight person would choose to marry someone they are incapable of loving romantically that is , someone of the same sex . similarly , no homosexual person with self interest would decide to play the game of life against their own welfare and commit themselves to a life with someone they cannot love . or rather , they should not be forcing themselves to do this . so in the end by not recognising the union between gay couples , by denying them the legal benefits or rights , rather of marriage , there really is nothing gained , and you lose out on a whole lot of people being happy . our government s always had such a big emphasis on equality . in race , in religion , in education . so why should sexual orientation not be one of these aspects ?

"a conservative sec school would be a bad idea for telling the teachers , but some mncs here do have policies against such workplace bullying of its trans workers .","im not op but it should be helpful to keep in mind that they might choose a new name and wish to be referred by different pronouns if they haven t done so already . however , everyone s journey is different and some are not yet comfortable with being so public , so if they haven t done so , there s no need to push it . but other than using the new name and pronouns , just treat them as you would any other person . if you see or hear someone else mocking or harassing them about their gender identity , you can speak up and say it is not cool . while the harasser might not agree with how that trans person is and lives their life , the harasser should not be rude . being uncomfortable about another person doesn t mean getting to drop basic courtesy and respect , just keep it to their own self . if it is a trans friend who is confiding in you about having been bullied , i think just listening and validating that their experience was unfair and uncalled for , is already a good step . you can admit that you might not understand to the fullest , but you are against such bullying behaviour and hope your friend can stay strong . you can also provide advice like hotlines and charities if you think it is getting way too out of hand , and those might be helpful . it is also possible in some situations to advise going to the authorities but it depends e . g . a conservative sec school would be a bad idea for telling the teachers , but some mncs here do have policies against such workplace bullying of its trans workers . as for having a child of nonconforming gender identity , i think it is important to reassure them that you love them as a child no matter the choices they make . let them dress as they wish and ask to be referred in certain ways , but don t shield them from the fact that living their truth means life can get hard especially here and others might make their disapproval well known . for example , your child might choose to remain semi closeted as a teenager to avoid social backlash , and that is still a valid personal decision and compromise they personally chose . many trans people also struggle with the mental health aspects of social backlash , so being sensitive to your child s emotional well being and possibly referring them to a good psychologist is key . however , trans people with supportive parents already by virtue of that fare much better , so your child would be lucky and very likely to turn out ok . and if your child wants surgery as an adult , most of the time young adults do not have the money for the sheer cost of it , so it might be helpful for them if you can chip in just a portion , and it s something you could save up for if you think it might happen .

they are the only ones against abolishment of 377a like laws ? what about those states where gay sex is punishable by death . quite a few of them around . and they fare worse then ccp in terms of gay rights . but no mention of it from you . but just solely on ccp . i wonder why . we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war . so you are spilling over your dislike of ccp in regards to those matters to this ?

can see you are no longer logical . not sure what you are smoking there . what next ? law makers are coming are with anti robbery laws because they are afraid they might become robbers themselves ? then they might as well not have the law and enjoy themselves by making it legal fulfilling their desires or tendencies legallly rather then fighting against their innate desires , why go through all the trouble ? as for the homesexuality part being immoral . not sure why you brought up the immoral part . a celibate homosexual is more moral than a promiscuous hetereosexual . a better way to put it is , its against nature rather then immoral . heterosexuality is part of human evolution in terms of the continuance of human population . not to mention , those body parts when in unison , were not mean to perform those task , which is why proportionally there is a higher risk of contracting stds , hiv , monkeypox , suffering from incontinence etc . in gays then heterosexuals . . because nature did not mean those body parts for that . which is why i support maintaining status quo not further tightening of the law . by that , i mean the law existing in name to permeate the state of mind that gay sex is discouraged , even though the act was no longer stricly enforced while not actually in most cases punishing gay sex itself . which is i believe the most popular sentiment among the general population excluding lgbts it would have been better to strengthen or come up protective laws against depriving gays , lgbts who are out of the closet , of job opportunities , etc . rather then repealing the act . problems is , there are people like you who like to jump to conclusions . not supporting the repealing of the act gays should be punished heavily or homophobia blah blah . of course i am not ruling out the existence of such people . but there are different schools of thought even among those who do not support the repealing of the act . some take a more aggressive stance , some take a more middle ground . regarding good values , you have good values because you support repealing of the act ? seems like quite a loose definition of good values if so . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . not sure if repealing of the act , but embedding the defintion of marriage only between man and women into the contsitution , making it not challengable in court is exactly boost the international image , attract more international investments that u define . maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . nah , i don t take it personally . hope you seriously don t too . i am also fine that you are the judge of howthose who dun support repealing of the act are , traditionalists , suck at justifying and challenging , and not being able to accept new norms . after all , delusional or not , your opinions and sentiments must be superior to those that contrast to you and it is the universal truth . and yes , i believe you are not even a pro homo person after reading your post which is not even actually pro homo .

"also , i m gonna call out the homosexuality is a choice thing , as it is proven bullshit .","saw this article and wanted to get this out of my system . the writer s arguments are anything but well thought out . they rely on fallacious arguments and non sequiturs . lets take a look from the very top . the government maintains a position that all religious communities are free to give voice to their conscience in matters that have moral impact . people of religious faith have equal right to be included in rather than dismissed from the public forum of debate . some homosexual rights advocates argue that religious citizens should refrain from arguing that the state laws should criminalise conduct that they consider immoral . this line of argument actually contradicts the definition of secularism . for what they are really saying is you shouldn t make laws based on your morality , but on mine instead . just because something is immoral to the religious i . e . a sin , doesn t mean it should be criminalised . for example , the bible raises all sorts of sins which no sane person would criminalise , such as wearing mixed cloth and worshipping other gods . on a broader point , singapore in a classical sense can never be called a pure secular state because it allows certain anomalies to exist 1 . independent schools both primary and secondary that are set up and run by religious groups e . g . acsi , sji . these schools are directly funded by the state 2 . islamic family courts system enacted in 1968 under the administration of muslim actadministers muslim personal law in legal matters governing marriages , divorces , the nullity of marriages and inheritance in singapore . 3 . the common law system underpinning our whole legal system is rooted in the judeo christian philosophical worldview . in the seventeenth century , sir matthew hale declared that the whole bible made up the common law of england . in 1767 , lord mansfield qualified this only slightly by declaring , the essential principles of revealed religion are part of the common law . oh we aren t really a secular state so we should just make our laws according to religious lines this guy . if personal enjoyment , consent , and commitment are all that is now required to declare a sexual behaviour legitimate , then there is no reasonable basis for withholding public recognition of polygamous polyamorous , adult brother sister unions or even adult adolescent unions . a quarter of the way in and this guy slippery slopes himself into legislating paedophilia , while conveniently forgetting the part where children can t consent . it is galling for singaporeans , who have seen their country progress so well to now be lectured by an elite group of liberals that they are intolerant bigots . for no other nation in human history , since empirical records have been kept , has advanced as quickly as the little island nation . despite having virtually no natural resources , singapore has gone from being a third world country in 1965 to a first world country in less than half a century . the world bank recorded that the gdp of singapore has grown 3700 from 1965 whereas the usa only grew 300 . children from the least privileged backgrounds have risen from great poverty to achieve remarkable success . acute poverty is now rare in singapore . other measures of success are equally impressive . infant mortality has been reduced faster than any other society in the last 50 years . students in singapore now top the charts consistently in international tests . for instance , the oecd ranked singaporean children number one in the world in a recent global rankingof universal basic skills in mathematics and science . yet we are told that we are backward and intolerant . economic progress ! social progress . when others call us backward and intolerant , they talk about our social policies and human rights . yet he harps on and on about things that are anything but that . this guy totally missed the point . singaporeans have made clear repeatedly that the vast majority oppose any attempts to remove s377a . this majority has likely grown over the last few decades with the growth of conservative religions , like christianity , in the wider population . for those who advocate repealing s377a we must ask what moral standards do you appeal to that will persuade us that society s current moral consensus is wrong ? if you can t persuade the majority , what gives you the right to declare by fiat that your moral code must supersede that of ours ? because the basic human rights of gays are being suppressed by these laws ? because their homesexuality does not harm others ? because we should uphold the rights of the minority , especially when said rights do not harm others ? the majority of people in singapore recognize that the homosexual lifestyle is harmful for the individual and society in general . statistics abound from all over the world to back up that statement with drug abuse , sexual transmitted diseases , depression , suicide rates disproportionately affecting those in the non heterosexual population . oh yeah , totally due to the the homosexual lifestyle , and totally not because we keep oppressing them . life expectancy is considerably lower . citation needed . this is found to be universally true even in societies where homosexuality is celebrated and encouraged . homosexuality leads to vastly inflated risks of physical and emotional harm to the individual . families and society at large are then often left to pick up the pieces of such a destructive lifestyle . . . . all the three great abrahamic religions are crystal clear that homosexuality is always a choice that can be rejected . society is replete with anecdotal evidence from both secular and religious people , who have turned their backs on the lifestyle . the weight of scientific evidence demonstrates that it is not innate or congenital , like skin colour , but rather an aspect of our freewill . the gay gene theory has been overwhelmingly debunked ! straight up lies right there . also , i m gonna call out the homosexuality is a choice thing , as it is proven bullshit . most singaporeans are suspicious that the repeal of s377a would unleash a range of thorny problems that would deeply disturb the fabric of our society . they have seen from the evidence to date in other countries that it leads to mandatory indoctrination of our children in the education system , gay adoption , gay marriage , discrimination against employees who morally disagree with the homosexual lifestyle , and flamboyant gay pride parades . some have even found themselves fined or imprisoned for opposing homosexual practice . in his 2007 speech in parliament that advocated retaining s377a , the current prime minister , mr lee hsien loong wisely noted that to change the law would result in the reality that gay activists will push for more . mr ho peng kee , then senior minister of state for home affairs in 2007 , also noted that there was an inherent danger in removing s377a . he pointed out , whilst homosexuals have a place in society , repealing section 377a will be very contentious and may send a wrong signal that government is encouraging and endorsing the homosexual lifestyle as part of our mainstream way of life . i m against repealing 377a because the government will force me and my children to be gay . this guy , basically . nothing has changed since 2007 , save for the fact that singaporeans have probably become even more religious . there is no objective evidence that the world is a better place for the diminishing of the traditional family unit as the central building block in any of these western societies . our society has prospered and developed at an incredible rate by maintaining our core family values . ah yes , if it ain t broke don t fix it . except that now we have homosexuals telling us that it is broke and for good reason . so maybe we should start on fixing it ? honestly , this guy s arguments are full of shit and reeks of intolerance . would not recommend 10 10 , 2 7 with rice .

my response i do not think intentionally childless couple are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples .,"boymoder said my response within my own circle , i do hear a number of sgreans renting public housing , so i do not agree that public housing renters are by and large foreigners this is an opinion , not a factual statement ? how does that prove that most renters are singaporeans ? nevertheless regardless of whether renters are singaporeans or foreigners , you mentioned your main concern is housing prices to finance retirement . but in the first place , housing isnt the primary source to financing retirement . saving , investing and cpf are the three key pillars of retirement for singaporeans . furthermore , singaporeans have low cpf savings and are unable to receive a good payout from cpf life which is the best retirement plan as it is a life long annuity , the root cause of low cpf savings is because singaporeans overspend their oa on property , because housing itself is unaffordable , so shouldnt the government ensure everyone has access to low cost housing bto in non mature estates so they can retire ? wanting to keep property values high is completely contradictory to helping the average singporean especially those who are currently young to retire . to who need it most . should childless couples be able to get 4 room flats and above then ? what if they never procreate ? most likely they will just use one room as their bedroom . proportionating of financial gains subsidized by the govt be part of the consideration , but rather frankly , i think the size is not the issue . since the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . since you think that lgbt singles do not deserve 4 room flats , do you think they should be able to purchase 2 3 room housing which is lesser in space so they can live with a roof over their head ? i would also like to understand more , why do you think childless couples are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples ? my response this statement i don t think is correct . if you look at purely the the cost of construction of the house , well it is cheap . but if you look at the cost of construction , housing is borne by the couples who pay for the flat , im not suggesting anyone receive free housing . the amenities , infrastructure of an estate is not only consumed by one single or one lgbt couple , but rather shared by the entire neighborhood . furthermore regardless of where a person lives , a single or lgbt couple would still consume infrastructure and amenities . furthermore if one does not have access to housing they are more likely to be a burden on the taxpayer through the use of social programs , healthcare etc . i think it is rather easy to see that elevating a person to being a productive member of society by allowing them to be able to afford a roof over their head and being able to contribute to society since they have a stable safety net is much better than them being reliant on handouts when they are stuck in poverty . can you clarify your stance , if singles and lgbt couples do not have housing , what do you think is the solution if not providing btos before 35 even if its just 2 or 3 room flats ? click to expand . . . my response i never say most renters are singaporeans ? i am just rejecting your statement that quote 90 of sgreans live in public housing renters are by and large foreigners . if this is your opinion , that s fine by me . housing instalments are paid by cpf , so housing value indirectly is one of the primary source for retirement . if you are praying for low cost housing bto and resale value , then how are the retirees getting back their cpf money to fund for their retirement ? optimally housing resale price should grow in sync with cpf accrued interest . should childless couples be able to get 4 room flats and above then ? what if they never procreate ? my response i explained myself earlier on this , you can read my post again . frankly , i think the size is not the issue . since the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . since you think that lgbt singles do not deserve 4 room flats , do you think they should be able to purchase 2 3 room housing which is lesser in space so they can live with a roof over their head ? my response i disagree that the marginal increase between the size of a 2 , 3 and 4room flat is frankly not significant . the size of 4 room is two times that of a 2 room . singles can purchase 2 room housing , which should be more than sufficient for one person . even many retiree couples also stay in a 2 room housing . for a lgbt couple , my suggestion as a work around is to first get a 2 room bto and then get a 3 room in the resale market when reach the age of 35 . it is normal for couples to upgrade their housing over time . i would also like to understand more , why do you think childless couples are more deserving of housing than singles lgbt couples ?

"whatever benefits the fake news bill brings is amorphous , much like a repeal of 377a ."," i feel that while we can agree that most singaporeans are not single issue voters , you cannot downplay the importance of certain issues in their influence to affect how voters behave . yes , but is there anything to show that 377a truly is one of these issues ? if you take reference abroad , politicians can win elections simply by swaying the voters emotionally , then go on to maintain high level of approval ratings despite not fulfilling election promises . and the pap has long cautioned about taking political lessons from abroad . i am not a fan of the pap , but i actually don t see how political developments abroad are illustrative for what might happen in singapore . we cannot deny that 377a is a very emotionally charged topic that can backfire , especially with people sitting on the fence . i think we can . 377a is an emotionally charged topic , but the extent that it might affect the vote , remains an open question . are you really suggesting that if the pap abolished 377a today , people who have voted for pap for most of their lives would vote for the wp instead ? that 377a would be a more defining issuing during that election than pap s track record , or the wp s alleged problems with their town counsel ? i find that difficult to believe . the thing about casinos is that it generates profits , theres a quantitative data that can show you how it benefits . it is the same for fake news bill , combating illegitimate news sources can prevent slander online the same way as how we banned newspapers that publish irresponsibly . these benefits can be quantified in ways that 377a cannot , thus its is not as motivating to take the risk . 377a has a profit element too , in the form of the pink dollar . moreover , i think that you don t seem to understand the objection to the casino the objections understand that obviously the casino will earn profits , but the objection arises because such profits are earned at the cost of a social ill which is gambling . plus , how exactly is the benefits of the fake news bill quantifiable in the same way as the profits of mbs ? if you can t put a number to it , i think it s a bit of a stretch to call it quantifiable . whatever benefits the fake news bill brings is amorphous , much like a repeal of 377a . or would it be wiser to wait until the political and societal landscape becomes more suitable before you take a stance , else risk losing votes ? but see again we circle back to the assumption that there is a real risk that votes would be lost . however i would like to point out that in our humble beginnings , we tried very hard to promote racial and religious harmony because we understood that our community have very weak social glue in part due to how diverse we are . this culture of avoiding religious conflict could have played a role in their stance against the repeal . you might want to read up a bit more about our humble beginnings . the abortion bill was passed despite massive religious protest . same as the women s charter , which enforced monogamous marriage . the early pap was entirely committed to having a neutral , secular , public space where everyone was regarded as equal , and no one religious view would be given a preferential position . i think that if we still really had that same commitment to racial and religious harmony , 377a should be abolished simply since it would show that no one religion or no two religions , if you include islam holds priority in public affairs . yet we are where we are now , where apparently letters from concerned christians are enough to get metal concerts banned , and the law minister feels comfortable highlighting that these concerts are attended by malay men . racial and religious harmony is a pretty poor explanation for the existence of 377a . edit i think that if you are able to agree with my view that the the government simply isn t as secular as it professes to be , and that many in government want to keep 377a for personal religious reasons , then i am curious as to why you seem to want to also push the view that there is some other practical basis for retaining 377a i . e . the possibility of losing votes . if 377a is being kept for the personal religious reasons of those in government , then whether votes might be lost or not becomes irrelevant , since personal religious reasons do not need to be affirmed by votes .

i find it surprising and perhaps difficult to understand what you mean by the fact that lgbtq folk are not deprived of their rights because according to the law they are .,"i will be addressing the points in your comment , but reorganized into better reading . regarding the change i agree that it s a big jump , if the repeal of 377a directly leads to gay marriage . but it plainly does not do that . furthermore , every small step towards greater acceptance should be welcomed . the law has a great impact in influencing people s behaviour and beliefs . if 377a exists , the message sent is plainly that homosexuals are somehow lesser citizens . lgbt folks are not fully accepted because of both society and the law how does one remove the law from society ? in this regard change can be effected , and not only welcomed when the entirety of society changes itself . even if society is largely conservative , the gap is slowly diminishing . this is a conversation lawmakers must have now before it becomes a much larger issue down the road . the law about being naked in your own home is usually if you are seen . this is similar to my earlier example of sex in public as these fall under public indecency laws . you won t get arrested for bathing , but you will be arrested if you strip in front of your window to the view of the entire hdb . when i say private relations , i mean what you do in absolute private , with no other party involved . as is , 377a outlaws regardless of whether you are seen etc . it is not the same to compare it to the nakedness law . religious and conservative folk try and stop homosexual relations , even though the efficacy of such attempts have widely been debunked by psychological and psychiatric studies . conversion therapy etc has largely been shown to be ineffectual . you seem to separate the section from the people who seek to curb homosexuality , although the creation of the section was indeed to curb homosexuality during the colonial era . i find it surprising and perhaps difficult to understand what you mean by the fact that lgbtq folk are not deprived of their rights because according to the law they are . they plainly cannot marry under the existing law . you too have actually agreed with me you acknowledged that they do not have the full benefits a straight person will enjoy . i m surprised as well to hear that their rights are not infringed upon legally , given that we are having a discussion about the very legal provision that does so . furthermore , the fact that people are arguing to keep the provision demonstrates that lgbt folk have lesser rights than us straight folk what they do in private can be entirely governed and affected by people who are completely unaffected by 377a . i hope that you can see the points i have put forth and where i m coming from .

"sometimes it s based on fluctuating criteria like if 4 out of 5 strangers a trans woman met today addressed her as xiao mei , then she would be better off in the female toilets ."," and as such i think its appropriate that the usual societal norms apply instead of giving transgender people a choice use the toilet corresponding to the sex you are most commonly identified with , not your gender . while i agree on principle , the problem with that framing is that it implies trans people aren t already doing so , and need a law to tell us what is basically common sense as well as a matter of our own safety . so that can come across as patronizing and is one reason for the backlash . it s more or less standard practice for trans people to only switch toilets once they re regularly read as that gender , and to use unisex handicapped toilets or not go at all when in early transition . public toilets are a source of major anxiety and stress for most if not all trans people . so the idea that someone would willingly choose to use a toilet where they stand out more and thus experience more stress is counterintuitive . it s also typically the trans person experiencing the greatest discomfort in those scenarios , whereas i find that a lot of those examples tend to assume that it s everyone else who is uncomfortable while the trans person is totally chill . i thus believe that trans people should have a choice , because figuring out what toilet you should go to is stressful enough without bringing the threat of the law into it . sometimes it s based on fluctuating criteria like if 4 out of 5 strangers a trans woman met today addressed her as xiao mei , then she would be better off in the female toilets . but if she just had a haircut and everyone has been calling her xiao di , then maybe she ll choose to use the male toilets on that day . there s really not much incentive to do otherwise , unless someone wishes to intentionally stand out to make a political statement but that s another matter altogether , and wouldn t apply to most cases . especially when it s singaporeans , who are mostly obedient and afraid of confrontation .

"mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin ."," government considering best way forward on 377a , will respect different viewpoints shanmugam court s decision consistent with past position on 377a mr shanmugam noted that successive court judgments over the years have consistently taken the position that these are highly contentious social issues and within the province of parliament . the heterosexual stable family remains a stable norm , he added . the current legal position reflects our society s norms , values and attitudes . that s what the courts have said . in its judgment , the court noted that the compromise which singapore has struck , in respect to section 377a , is unique , said mr shanmugam . our approach strikes a balance between preserving the legislative status quo , whilst accommodating the concerns of those directly affected by the legislation . the court recognised that the government did this in order to avoid driving a deeper wedge within our society , he added . it also noted that singapore s approach seeks to keep what to do with section 377a within the democratic space . socially charged issues , such as section 377a , call for continued discussion and open ended resolution within the political domain , where we can forge consensus , rather than in win lose outcomes in court . in this way , we can accommodate divergent interests , avoid polarisation and facilitate incremental change , said mr shanmugam . additionally , the court highlighted the importance of creating space for peaceful co existence among various groups , especially since the balance between the various interests around section 377a has grown more delicate . these opinions align with the approach that the government has taken in dealing with section 377a , and that it intends to take as it considers the changes in our social landscape since 2007 . in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong said in parliament , when the penal code was amended but section 377a left unchanged , that we want to be a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society , said mr shanmugam . mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin . this remains our stand today , added mr shanmugam . our emphases on gradual evolution and on traditional families remain constant . shifting attitudes towards homosexuality however , since the issue was last discussed in parliament in 2007 , social attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted , mr shanmugam acknowledged . one of the things that upsets the lgbt community is that many feel that their experience of being hurt or rejected by their families , friends , schools , companies is not recognised , indeed often denied . at the same time , a large majority want to preserve the overall tone of our society , said mr shanmugam . in particular , the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman , and that children should be raised within such a family structure . their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family . many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men . both these viewpoints are valid and important , he added . live and let live approach noting that these are deeply divisive issues , mr shanmugam said that is why the government takes a live and let live approach . we seek to be an inclusive society , where mutual respect and tolerance for different views and practices are paramount . government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement . and agc takes a similar approach . mr shanmugam added that the government had expressly included in the mrha maintenance of religious harmony act that any attack on lgbt groups , or on persons because they are lgbt , will be an offence , and won t be tolerated . lgbt individuals are entitled to live peacefully , without being attacked or threatened , he said . likewise , any attack on any other group , based on their religion , or religious beliefs , even if those beliefs run counter to values held by lgbt groups will not be acceptable . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",03-03-2022 16:08,Reddit,homosexual,1

the first question which trans people are concerned with is not in any way a slippery slope to the second which pedophiles are concerned with .,"thanks ! my team is generally aligned . incidentally , most of us are also christians , myself included . we also skew young i m 30 next year , the youngest two are still in uni and the older members are even less political . of course it s a political movement , though all movements are political . america has many , many , many problems of its own , including the way that many americans are very argumentative and love to sue other people for all sorts of things . whereas singaporeans are stereotypically obedient and conflict avoidant even in cases of injustice when we should be speaking up , so i honestly doubt anything like that would ever happen here . if it did , it would die off pretty quickly . we are not americans . the contrast between pink dot and the average pride march is a good enough indication of that . america s anti discrimination laws were also the product of its racial history with segregation , and how those laws were specifically enacted so that businesses could not discriminate against racial minorities and other marginalised groups . this is not the case in singapore , for better or worse which is why you can see rental ads declaring no indians and such . which is terrible , but i m not sure the law is the best way to deal with that . nonetheless , i do think that this too falls under the umbrella of acceptance . a society where the majority of businesses refuse to serve lgbt people would not be an accepting society at all . while i believe people and business owners should have the right to act according to their conscience , there s also the question of where we draw the line what if a gay man has cancer and hospitals refuse to treat him ? which has happened to at least one trans man , who died as a result . or restaurants refuse to let him eat there , and grocery stores won t sell him food ? at some point i think there need to be policies in place to protect minority groups and ensure they can access the same services that allow them to live and function in society . in the us there s also a distinction between public and private businesses private businesses are allowed to make their own rules regarding who they wish to serve , but public ones which the bakery fell under are not . each is covered by different regulations and thus obligations . i think there s also some provision for refusing service to individuals e . g . the recently freed serial killer who murdered your kids but not to an established protected minority . to advance their own goals what goals would those be ? i ve seen a lot of fear mongering around that , but with no clear motive in place . but then how would you know it is not a slippery slope to pedophilia at all ? . . . somehow you are a ok with them knowing what gender they are . dont you find that very paradoxical ? because the two have nothing at all to do with each other . it is entirely appropriate to ask a four year old are you a boy or a girl ? people do that all the time . but it is entirely inappropriate to ask that same four year old would you want to have sex with me ? the first question which trans people are concerned with is not in any way a slippery slope to the second which pedophiles are concerned with . i dont think it is a good idea to pump young children full of hormone and other drugs i agree , but transgender children are not given any medical treatment until puberty . such treatment is unnecessary at that point . transition in their case is just social , and on a case by case basis depending on what that particular child needs . most clinics that treat trans children operate on a harm reduction basis e . g . if a kid is crying every day because they want shorter hair , they can start by getting the kid a haircut and seeing if that helps . if that s enough , it can stop there . if not , they can continue slowly taking things step by step , constantly monitoring how the child responds , all the way to full social transition if necessary . at puberty , if the child still fulfils the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and expresses clinically significant distress over the physical changes of puberty , they may be assessed as suitable candidates for hormone blockers , which not all trans youth may choose to have . these have been used safely for decades in children with precocious puberty , which is arguably what most children go through nowadays a century ago , children didn t hit puberty until their mid teens or later , so delaying puberty might even be beneficial . while there may still be mild side effects , the benefits in this case far outweigh any consequences . here s one long term study http pediatrics . aappublications . org content early 2014 09 02 peds . 2013 2958 . abstract of 55 trans youths who underwent hormone blockers at puberty followed by hormone replacement therapy several years later . the results after 7 years were overwhelmingly positive , where the youths scored equal or better than their non trans peers on various mental health assessments . there were 0 suicides . this is particularly striking given that trans youth who don t undergo this treatment have always scored very badly on mental health assessments , with almost half attempting suicide . this other study http pediatrics . aappublications . org content early 2016 02 24 peds . 2015 3223 involved prepubescent transgender children who had socially not medically transitioned , with similarly positive results developmentally normal rates of depression and anxiety , vs . the highly elevated rates normally observed in transgender children who are unable to socially transition . so what we know right now is that enabling transition for trans youth is effective , and has been the first approach in history that has not just reduced but normalised the high rates of depression , anxiety and suicidal attempts typically associated with the trans community . that s why trans activists are striving to make this more accessible . i was a trans kid once , and if transition had been an option for me it would have saved me years of unnecessary psychological distress and resulting therapy , plus one suicide attempt , and i hope for a day when no more trans children have to go through what i and many of my friends did .

equality for lgbtq people in singapore , in a community statement signed by 22 lgbtq groups .","lgbtq groups have expressed relief at the government s intention to repeal section 377a in the penal code , which criminalises sex between men , calling it the first step on a long road towards full equality for lgbtq people in singapore , in a community statement signed by 22 lgbtq groups . issued on sunday aug 21 , the statement stated that the repeal would be a significant milestone and a powerful statement that state sanctioned discrimination has no place in singapore . the groups include action for aids singapore , free community church , pink dot sg , young out here , project x , and oogachaga , among others . the demise of section 377a represents something different to each individual , the statement pointed out . for some who have experienced bullying , rejection and harassment enabled by the law , repeal would enable the beginning of a process of healing . for others , however , repeal would have arrived far too late . for those that long for a more equal and inclusive singapore , repeal signifies that change is indeed possible . and for our friends and family who have stood by us , repeal is proof and encouragement that your allyship makes a difference , it said . to the past victims of section 377a and its cascading effects , including those who have faced threats of police entrapment , raids and criminal charges , repeal will never be able to fully right the historic wrongs that you faced . to others whom we have lost along the way , we have not forgotten the heavy toll that this law has exacted on you and your loved ones . the statement also acknowledged the generations of activists , community groups and allies . their advocacy often came at great personal cost but paved the way for policy and societal change , as well as kept hope alive for many . the statement from the lgbtq groups suggested that the government s intention to repeal section 377a is only the start . it noted the immediate priorities would be to tackle the areas of discrimination at home , in schools and in workplaces , as well as in housing and healthcare systems . the true impact of repeal will be determined by how the people of singapore respond to it , and treat each other , in the days and months to come . it must be accompanied by the rejection of hate , of stigma , of discrimination , of erasure . it must be the beginning of us finding common ground and having open conversations about our collective futures , it said . we cannot allow this to polarise us , deepen fissures , or make an already vulnerable community more susceptible to contempt . we must , in the face of potential backlash , strengthen ties within our community and look out for one another . echoing similar sentiments , indignation told cna separately that public discourse is likely to become more heated and toxic as singapore heads towards a repeal . we wish to remind the members of our community that you are not alone in these trying times . our community has a long history of weathering hostility . look out for one another . practice care and compassion , both for yourself and your fellow queers . reach out to your local queer organisations if you need to , it said . reminding the lgbtq community to engage in meaningful discussions with those who matter , mr choong and mr leow from oogachaga reiterated that these discussions should be done in a safe and respectful manner , with facts and evidence , not opinions and misinformation . the statement from the lgbtq groups added that the repeal would be a hard won victory and a triumph of love over fear . as we celebrate this historical milestone , we urge the community , and indeed all singaporeans , to continue to imagine and work toward a better future for all , it said . a society without section 377a is a society that is more progressive , not just for lgbtq people , but for everyone . no one is free until everyone is free . this is a win for humanity . when section 377a is repealed , it will not only improve the lives of lgbtq singaporeans and their families , it will also bring other benefits to business , trade , and boost our international reputation as a progressive , developed economy , added oogachaga s mr choong and mr leow . meanwhile , action for aids afa singapore believes the repeal would result in more effective and safer sex education . this has been a long awaited decision on a law that has been a structural barrier to more effective safer sex education for gay and other men who have sex with men in singapore , said the organisation . with the abolition of section 377a , afa will work to increase and strengthen efforts to eliminate the stigma and discrimination faced by gay and other men who have sex with men , and the wider lgbtq communities in accessing early diagnosis and care for hiv infection , stds and other health challenges . the organisation looks forward to more inclusive sexuality education programmes in schools , and fairer portrayal of men who have sex with men in the media that can facilitate treatment and prevention of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases std . afa has long believed that removing section 377a will significantly strengthen hiv and std control programmes in singapore , not just for gay and

"likewise , the people who organise the protect singapore townhall exercised their rights , he said , adding that the event did not break any laws ."," views on 377a government looking at how to safeguard current legal position on marriage , says shanmugam singapore the singapore government is looking at how it can safeguard the current legal position on marriage against challenges in the courts , while it considers the next steps for section 377a of the penal code , said law and home affairs minister k shanmugam on saturday jul 30 . mr shanmugam was responding to media queries about updates on the government s efforts to seek views on the law , which criminalises sex between men . on section 377a , authorities have had extensive discussions so far with different religious leaders , grassroots leaders , singaporeans from all walks of life , as well as representatives of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender lgbt groups , mr shanmugam told reporters at tzu chi humanistic youth centre . the general sense of the discussion is this many agree that men who have sex with each other should not be thrown into prison . gay sex should not be criminalised , he said . at the same time , most do not want any decriminalisation to cause other major changes . in particular , most people want the current position on marriage which is defined by law as between a man and a woman to be retained . people don t want that to change and people also do not want any change to the current policies that take reference from this definition of marriage , said mr shanmugam . he added that the government understands this view and is now considering how best to achieve a balance . the two questions we are dealing with are one , what is to be done with section 377a . two , at the same time , we are also considering how can we safeguard the current legal position on marriage from being challenged in the courts , so that it does not get challenged like the way section 377a was , the minister added . these matters really ought to be discussed in parliament , and decided in parliament , and not decided in the courts . mr shanmugam was also asked about protect singapore townhall , a gathering that was held on jul 23 calling for the protection of marriage , family and children in light of the government considering a repeal of section 377a . the closed door gathering was organised by dads for life and the yellow ribbon project founder jason wong and suchi success initiatives chief executive officer mohamed khair . police reports were made about the event but the authorities said no action will be taken against the organisers as the gathering did not break any laws . in explaining the decision , mr shanmugam noted how the pink dot event was held last month . likewise , the people who organise the protect singapore townhall exercised their rights , he said , adding that the event did not break any laws . but the minister stressed that authorities will step in if there is any incitement and attacks or running down of any groups by either side . we can expect more of this as both sides seek to get heard , and these events really illustrate what the government has been saying for a long time that if one side pushes , then there will be a push back and we have seen this happen in many countries , he added . if it happens here in singapore . . . the ruptures will tear our social fabric apart and cause a lot of harm . this is why the government has been advocating moderation , moving carefully on this issue and not push positions which can damage society , said mr shanmugam . people genuinely believe in one or another view with great intensity , and we have to try and deal with the issues with an open mind and open heart . avoid extreme positions and avoid extreme demands , he added . move forward , try and be united , work on our differences in a calm way , for the sake of singapore . section 377a has stirred many debates and even legal challenges over the years . on feb 28 this year , the court of appeal upheld a lower court s decision to dismiss three challenges to section 377a . days later , mr shanmugam said in parliament that the government is considering the best way forward on the law , adding that the government will respect different viewpoints and consider them carefully . last month , the minister reiterated that while attitudes towards section 377a are shifting , the government cannot ignore the views of a significant proportion of the population who do not want the law repealed . he stressed that even though the old piece of law makes gay sex an offence , the position in singapore is that people engaging in it will not be prosecuted . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",30-07-2022 18:32,Reddit,rights,1

masterpiece cakeshop , has religious objections to same sex marriage and had lost a discrimination case for refusing to create a cake to celebrate such a nytimes published 28june2017 . baker s supreme court appeal pits laws on discrimination against religious freedom washington the us supreme court has agreed to hear an appeal from a colorado baker with religious objections to same sex marriage who had lost a discrimination case for refusing to create a cake to celebrate such a union . the case will be a major test of a clash between laws that ban businesses open to the public from discriminating based on sexual orientation and claims of religious freedom . across the united states , businesses such as bakeries , florists and photography studios have said , so far with little success , that forcing them to serve gay couples violates their constitutional rights . the supreme court s decision , expected next year , will again take the justices into a heated battle in the culture wars . on one side are gay and lesbian couples who say they are entitled to equal treatment from businesses that choose to serve the general public . on the other are religious people and companies who say the government should not force them to choose between the requirements of their faiths and their livelihoods . in a series of decisions culminating in its 2015 ruling establishing a constitutional right to same sex marriage , the supreme court has consistently ruled in favour of gay rights . but it has also said that businesses run on religious principles may sometimes be exempted from generally applicable laws , as when it ruled in 2014 that some companies could not be required to provide free contraceptive coverage for their female workers . the new case , masterpiece cakeshop v colorado civil rights commission , no . 16 111 , started in 2012 , when baker jack phillips , an owner of masterpiece cakeshop in lakewood , colorado , refused to create a cake for the wedding reception of mr david mullins and mr charlie craig , who were planning to marry in massachusetts . the couple filed discrimination charges , and they won before a civil rights commission and in the courts . the case will be a major test of a clash between laws that ban businesses open to the public from discriminating based on sexual orientation and claims of religious freedom . this has always been about more than a cake , mr mullins said . businesses should not be allowed to violate the law and discriminate against us because of who we are and who we love . however , mr phillips , who calls himself a cake artist , argued that two parts of the first amendment its protections for free expression and religious freedom overrode a colorado anti discrimination law and allowed him to refuse to create a custom wedding cake . mr david cortman , one of mr phillips lawyers , said the case concerned fundamental rights . every american should be free to choose which art they will create and which art they won t create without fear of being unjustly punished by the government , he said . in 2015 , a colorado appeals court ruled against mr phillips . masterpiece does not convey a message supporting same sex marriages merely by abiding by the law and serving its customers equally , the court said . in a supreme court brief , lawyers for mr phillips said he is happy to create other items for gay and lesbian clients . but his faith requires him , they said , to use his artistic talents to promote only messages that align with his religious beliefs . thus , the brief said , he declines lucrative business by not creating goods that contain alcohol or cakes celebrating halloween and other messages his faith prohibits , such as racism , atheism , and any marriage not between one man and one woman . the brief also said mr mullins and mr craig could have bought a cake from another baker and , in fact , easily obtained a free wedding cake with a rainbow design from another bakery . in response , the couple s lawyer wrote that it is no answer to say that mullins and craig could shop somewhere else for their wedding cake , just as it was no answer in 1966 to say that african american customers could eat at another restaurant . nytimes a version of this article appeared in the print edition of the straits times on june 28 , 2017 , with

"even then , social traits like homosexuality would not be heavily selected against as kinship ties are still highly important in the modern state .","it is highly unlikely for homosexuals to be selected against in an evolutionary sense . we have to take into account the fact that the modern state is a very recent concept , and that kinship ties and sexual selection still play important roles in sexual reproduction under the modern state . evolution occurs over a very very long span of time . if you take a pre historic human thousands and thousands of years ago and compare him her to a modern human , both of them would be biologically indistinguishable . the whole of human history is but a blip in the evolutionary timeline . the concept of a modern state , is as the name suggests , modern and thus would have had a negligible effect on human evolution so far . only if the structure of a modern state persists for tens of thousands of years can we perhaps start seeing an evolutionary change in human populations whereby anti social traits are able to persist since they are not as heavily selected against as they would before . even then , social traits like homosexuality would not be heavily selected against as kinship ties are still highly important in the modern state . we still organize ourselves into extended family groups and occasionally look to relatives for support when things get tough . in addition , as i pointed out in my earlier post , homosexuality may also confer benefits to heterosexual reproduction . if a particular trait has a strong effect on making women more sexually attractive , while a weak effect in making men homosexual , selection pressures will then allow these homosexual traits to persist in populations as they benefit heterosexual reproduction with only a minor evolutionary drawback in the rare homosexual cases . of course , vice versa can happen . read the bbc article linked in my previous post . ultimately , this means that as long as sexual reproduction in humans occurs , homosexuality can still persist as it benefits the overall population . and i think we can agree on the fact that sexual reproduction is definitely still around in the era of the modern state . in conclusion , homosexuality still plays a part in the modern state , whether by conferring kinship or sexual reproductive benefits . this , of course , presupposes the fact that the modern state will continue to be structurally present for tens of thousands of years such that it has an impact on evolution which is not highly likely . the only way for homosexuality to be considered evolutionary non advantageous would be in a dystopian modern state where the government decides who you have sex and raise a child with no sexual attractiveness factor in reproduction and each nuclear family is governmentally forbidden from ever knowing or interacting with their extended family no kinship factor . and this government must persist for many many millennia . i think one option is likelier than the other .

associate melvin tay and research assisant shanthini selvarajan . between 2013 and 2018 , there have been steep drops in opposition towards lgbt issues , the study said . but divisions along this faultline are likely to deepen , given the role that other social divides such as religion , age and education level play in shaping attitudes towards lgbt issues . christian respondents were the most likely to be amenable to religious leaders being vocal about lgbt issues . slightly over half of them said they would be comfortable with it , while the majority of those professing other religions or no religion between 55 to 71 per cent said they would feel uncomfortable . older and less educated respondents were also more likely to indicate discomfort with religious leaders engaging in public discourse on lgbt issues . this could be due to younger and more educated respondents being more inclined towards free speech , the study said . on the potential consequences of managing lgbt issues poorly , younger and more educated respondents were more likely to feel this could result in polarisation , anger against particular communities and falling levels of trust in the government . half of those aged 18 to 25 , the youngest cohort surveyed , said polarisation and anger were likely consequences , as did more than half of respondents who held a bachelor s degree and above . just over a third of those aged above 65 , and those with secondary education and below , felt the same way . about 27 per cent of the youngest respondents and 28 per cent of degree holders felt that erosion of trust in the government was likely compared to less than 18 per cent for both the oldest and least educated respondents . this could indicate that lgbt issues were seen as more crucial among younger and more educated respondents , who tended to be more accepting of lgbt rights , the study said . christian respondents , who were more likely to hold conservative views on gender and sexuality , also indicated the highest levels of concern over all of the potential consequences compared to those of other religious affiliations . this illustrates the significance of lgbt issues to christians in relation to their faith , the study said . the divisiveness of lgbt issues also came through in respondents desired levels of state involvement and public discussion . younger respondents and those who said they held more liberal views on sexuality were the most likely to want greater government involvement and more public discussion of lgbt issues . the potential reasons for them wanting more government involvement could be in the form of ensuring equal rights for lgbt people or repealing section 377a , said dr mathews . section 377a of the penal code criminalises consensual sex between men , an offence which carries up to a two year jail term . older respondents and those who said they held neutral or more conservative views on sexuality were more likely to feel the current levels of government involvement and public discussion are sufficient . christians 46 per cent and muslims about 44 per cent were also more likely to support greater government involvement but for different reasons . adherents of monotheistic faiths are less likely to support lgbt rights , and may want state involvement in the form of retaining section 377a or curtailing the rise of lgbt discourse and events such as the annual pro lgbt pink dot rally , the study said . they may want government involvement to deal with what might be seen as intrusions on the status quo , said dr mathews . but a sizeable proportion of muslims also indicated that they wanted less government involvement 21 per cent of muslims fell into this category , compared to just 12 . 6 per cent of christians and 18 . 1 per cent of respondents overall . this implies that within the muslim community , there are significant differences in views on whether lgbt issues should fall within the ambit of governance and policy , the study said . 1 . 0 . 1 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",29-10-2019 21:34,Reddit,rights,-1

"she had asked what indicators the government will look at to determine whether society is ready for the repeal of section 377a , and how these indicators are monitored ."," parliament govt speaking with diverse groups on section 377a , will seek to balance viewpoints , says shanmugam singapore minister for home affairs and law k . shanmugam said on monday april 4 that the government has been consulting and will continue to speak with a diverse groups of singaporeans to better understand their viewpoints on a law criminalising sex between men . it will consider the various views carefully as it decides on the next steps for singapore , he added . mr shanmugam was answering a question in parliament from ms yeo wan ling pasir ris punggol grc , who asked how the government is engaging different groups on the issue of section 377a of the penal code . a recent court of appeal ruling on feb 28 had said the law will stay on the books , but cannot be used to prosecute men for having gay sex , reigniting the debate on whether the law should be changed or repealed . several ministers , including mr shanmugam , subsequently spoke about the issue , noting that societal attitudes towards marriage and family have changed over time and stating the government s position that singapore will uphold a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society . reiterating this on monday , mr shanmugam said since the subject was discussed in parliament in 2007 , societal attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted . he added that there are currently two main viewpoints on the issue and many subsidiary viewpoints . on the one hand , the vast majority of singaporeans are of the view that the heterosexual marriage between a man and a woman , must remain the bedrock of our society . on the other hand , many singaporeans , including some of those who believe in the traditional family structure , feel that private consensual sex between men should not be criminalised , he said . we will consider the various views carefully , and assess the best way forward , that tries to balance the different viewpoints . a recent public survey by government feedback unit reach on the law , and more broadly on lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt issues , had drawn more than 30 , 000 responses by the time it closed on march 23 . this far exceeded the usual number of several hundred to a few thousand replies to other public polls . reach said the feedback will be shared with relevant agencies and could be used within the government for policy updates and changes . on monday , mr shanmugam also noted that progress singapore party psp non constituency mp hazel poa had filed a related question on the law for which she had requested a written answer . she had asked what indicators the government will look at to determine whether society is ready for the repeal of section 377a , and how these indicators are monitored . referring to this , mr shanmugam asked ms poa and her fellow psp ncmp leong mun wai to state psp s position on the law , saying that it will be good to know as it is an important issue . ms poa said as the minister has pointed out , there are two different camps with different views on this particular issue . and for us , within the party itself , we also have people with different views . so , this is not an issue that we actually have a consensus on , at this moment in time . to this , mr shanmugam said there are many different ways of saying i don t know . so , i assume that ms poa is saying either the party has no position , or they don t know what their position is . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",04-04-2022 15:46,Reddit,377a,0

"however , documents from the british national archives that were declassified in 2014 and 2016 reveal that section 377a was originally intended to curtail the spread of male prostitution , and not consensual private sexual acts between men ."," cna explains the history of 377a and how some countries have repealed it when was 377a introduced and why ? section 377a was introduced to singapore s penal code in the middle of 1938 when it was under british rule . it reads any male person who , in public or private , commits , or abets the commission of , or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of , any act of gross indecency with another male person , shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years . the law was generally believed to have derived from the british government s desire to safeguard public morality by prohibiting homosexual activity in the straits settlements . however , documents from the british national archives that were declassified in 2014 and 2016 reveal that section 377a was originally intended to curtail the spread of male prostitution , and not consensual private sexual acts between men . these were brought to light in 2019 by a legal team that sought to repeal the law . the documents showed that male prostitution was a widespread problem in the area at the time , especially among british civil servants . this eventually led section 377a to be passed in the legislative council of the straits settlements , and was later inherited by singapore . however , the origins of section 377a stretch back to 1860 , when it was first codified as section 377 in the indian penal code by the british empire as carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animal . it was then exported to at least 39 british colonies across asia , the pacific islands and africa . penalties range from two to 20 years in prison but in places that have also implemented sharia law , lgbt people can also face more severe punishment such as flogging . which countries have repealed the law , and which have not ? former british colonies that have repealed the legislation include india , seychelles and fiji . in 2018 , india s highest court unanimously struck down part of section 377 of the indian penal code , which outlaws same sex relations , following 17 years of legal challenges mounted by activists . in the landmark judgment , india s supreme court ruled that it was unconstitutional in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex . criminalising carnal intercourse under section 377 of the indian penal code is irrational , indefensible and manifestly arbitrary , said then chief justice dipak misra in his delivery of the unanimous verdict on sep 6 , 2018 . evolving social attitudes towards lgbt issues have also been attributed to the repealing of 377 . in 2011 , india included a third gender category in addition to the male and female options in its census forms for the first time . bhutan decriminalised homosexuality last year , making it legal to have gay sex and easing restrictions on same sex relationships . the move by the majority buddhist nation of 800 , 000 people came after other asian countries including india and nepal relaxed restrictions on the rights of lgbt people . according to researchers , much of bhutan s penal code was adopted from us laws . however , there are parts about sodomy and unnatural sex , which appear to be identical to language in other penal codes around south asia that was copied from the indian penal code . besides singapore , former british colonies where 377 continues to exist in various forms include malaysia , brunei , pakistan , bangladesh , sri lanka and myanmar . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",19-08-2022 17:12,Reddit,377a,0

as moral as murder being wrong and stealing being a violation of property rights .,"democracy is literally the politicisation of all things because itngives every person the right to have a say in all things . thereby politicising it . also i didnt make it a moral issue , i am saying that it politicises a moral issues . i e . democracy allows religioua folk to politicise their morals . i would like to ask what is objective about 377a or repealing it ? human rights activists believe that people should be able to love and have sex with whoever they want . is that objective ? or a point of view . there s nothing objective about human rights , its a moral stand point . as moral as murder being wrong and stealing being a violation of property rights . since u brought up abortion . i will tell you . people have sex and thisbis related to the prostitution point . and the outcome of sex is often pregnancies . now abortion is basically an economic solution to unwanted pregnancies . unwanted pregnancies ar effectively an economic burden . and thats pretty objective . especially so for teen mom s . so legalising abortion especially for girls as young as 14 gives them and women the safe option to terminate unwanted pregnancies and get on with their lives . not to mention pregnancies by rape and down syndrom babies etc so theres the benefit of legalising abortion . if there was an equally compelling economic argument which is as objective as you can get for repealing 377a which would outweight the moral outrage from conservative voters , 100 the govt would do that . just like they did with gambling and why they continue to allow other vices . so clearly the govt doesn t feel that all the benefits you state are sufficient ? about your point on prep and that 377a blocks it . quick google shows that prep is readily available privately and even from the govt . the only argument u have is that the stigma of illegality of homosexual intercourse may prevent people from seeking treatment and not an issue of availability . but like the abortion example , the solution isnt legalising the problematic behaviour but resolving the problem , i . e . 377a will not be enforced . and before u jump on me , the problematic behaviour is engaging in higher risk sexual activity . and all the benefits u stated only accrue to one group , the lgbt community . so repealing 377a benefits no one other than a specific group . clearly thats not a large enough voter base for it to be a metric for policy setting . so end of the day . it s politics and economics . you can t argue for a law because it is the right thing to do . hey i dont really care about whether 377a gets repealed or not . i m just pointing out that just cause u don t like a law doesnt mean it shld get repealed . whether q law is changed is entirely due to whether it is politically expedient and as of now , its not expedient to repeal it .

deliberately included sub threshold gd kids and included two questionnaires that had high sensitivity and specificity in that sample adolescents reports of gd and body image were compared across persisters and desisters , and showed that persisters reported more gd than desisters in the mean total scores of both the giiaa and the ugds . clinically , for the giiaa , scores of less than 3

onset of puberty . we re not , we re talking about gender identity , that the blaunchedcauli correctly said that as far as we know starts being expressed by about age 3 . it is undeniable that puberty causes an immense change in our psychology . to stop a child s psychological development for the sake of a political agenda is child abuse . that s not stopping the development of psychology for the sake of a political agenda . if you think that either testosterone or estrogen are necessary for psychological development then we should be administering that earlier , not later . i ve not seen any negative studies on kids starting puberty at 16 the age of medical consent in the uk and some us states as opposed younger endogenous puberty timings . it s also for the sake of preventing the development of secondary sex characteristics the kids don t want , idk what the political agenda is . 2 . there are medically advised age limits for medications for children with such disorders . . .

is required because the authors assume that experiencing one s own puberty is diagnostically useful . it is at the onset of puberty that it becomes clear whether the gender dysphoria will desist or persist puberty blockers pb are only administered after a child has already undergone some pubertal changes , and even then they only delay puberty , where stopping pbs continue endogenous puberty . cross sex hormones are generally only administered at 16 again the medical age of consent in some major countries . we don t have to resort to hypothetical trans kids making a heavy decision , we

"re walt heyer he previously said so in his own words that he was not actually trans , and used to frame his story as a case of medical malpractice and misdiagnosis .","it helps to look into why those adults regretted it , though . for example , misdiagnosis is more common for adults because they undergo much more lenient assessment often a one off diagnosis by one or two psychs , vs children who need to be assessed by a whole team of doctors and psychiatrists before social transition , are monitored throughout , and then have to go for another round of assessments before beginning puberty blockers , with continued monitoring . this provides more failsafes than it does for adults , who could just find a less rigorous doctor willing to approve them for treatment if they pay enough money . there s also how many of those adults transitioned a decade or more ago , when both doctors and patients were much less informed on trans issues and more prone to making misdiagnoses . regarding regret in particular , many reasons cited often had to do with dissatisfactory surgical results or health complications which thus concerned surgery and not transition in general , which have significantly improved over the years since the 1960s when those first patients were tracked , or from not being able to visually blend in with other people of their gender , which is a complete non issue for those who transition at puberty . another large source of regret was the abuse they received from family , friends and society after transition , such as being fired from their jobs and kicked out of their homes and made to resort to sex work to survive the regret thus came from deciding they would have rather tolerated living with dysphoria than have to live life that way . almost all of these problems do not exist for those who transition at puberty , who by necessity have supportive family , and who never develop the secondary sexual characteristics that would otherwise require additional surgery or make it difficult for them to look like others in their gender . more than that , as a society we do already trust children and young teenagers to know their gender . if we didn t , we would be mandating puberty blockers for everyone in case they turned out to be transgender and deeply regret going through the wrong puberty . statistically , the vast majority of children are not likely to be trans , which is why we don t but likewise , a child who fulfills the diagnostic criteria and has passed multiple assessments is statistically very likely to be trans , and treatment thus errs on the side of caution . re walt heyer he previously said so in his own words that he was not actually trans , and used to frame his story as a case of medical malpractice and misdiagnosis . that framing has since changed to present himself as a trans person who regretted transition .

just like how most singaporeans are against lesbians even though female homosexuality is also legal here .,"longer reply because you deserve a proper response , and i don t believe in silencing concerns . the thing is that you re conflating several issues laws around who can enter toilets , laws around trans people changing their legal sex , laws against sexual crimes , and social attitudes towards trans people . firstly , singapore has no law preventing people from entering and using toilets that do not match their legal sex . it is and has always been legal for trans people or anyone else to use the public toilets of their choice . individual institutions like schools may have different laws , but not singapore as a whole . so the claim that making it legal to do so would lead to an onrush of cross dressing sexual predators isn t supported by the reality that it is already legal to do so , and we re not seeing this happen . john is a sexual predator in country y , where it is legal for him to use a female toilet even though his i . c is male . nobody pays attention to him because hey who knows , she is a transgender . not nice calling people out . i m curious about why you think removing laws around gendered toilet use would equate to social acceptance of trans people . singapore does not have those laws i . e . we are already country y , nor any trans equivalent of 377a , and yet society is still strongly anti trans . just like how most singaporeans are against lesbians even though female homosexuality is also legal here . john is born a male , transition to female and changed her ic to female . she name herself jane . she still look masculine . jane enters the female toilet . some karen decide that she is a sexual predator . police came , checked that she is a female . everyone goes home . the end . happily ever after . but what if jane was rushing to school , or work , or had an emergency family situation at home ? there s also the stress of causing a scene and people staring while she s detained outside the toilet waiting for police to come . what if this happens every time she goes to pee ? note she is legally female in this scenario , so won t be allowed to use the male toilets instead . or what if jane was in fact trans and legally female , but also a sexual predator ? or what if she was a regular non trans legally female woman and a sexual predator ? the opposite could happen too . what if john from the earlier scenario was an actual guy who was in the female toilet for innocent reasons like if he was about to vomit and couldn t make it to the male toilet in time , or if he s intellectually disabled and made a mistake , or his mother screamed for help and he rushed in ? i m sure you can think of other scenarios . i don t think any of those should warrant calling the police , even though it s also possible that someone could use those excuses to peep on women . and it would be much easier and less conspicuous than dressing up . someone s gender should not be the focus when it comes to deciding whether a crime has been committed . asking is this person really trans , or only pretending to be ? is the wrong question . the right question would be did this person commit a sexual crime ? and if the answer is yes , it doesn t matter if this is a woman , man , genderfluid person , mp , your ah ma , or anyone else . it would still be wrong and still be a crime .

"we ll see , but with a majority who support lgbt rights , the ones pushing for it will have far more leverage ."," even if the demographic shifts towards majority support , it doesn t necessarily mean the pushback will lessen immediately . it means the voices speaking up for lgbt voices will get louder , thereby deafening the pushback somewhat . sure , there s a good possibility that we no longer see gender and sexual orientation in the polarizing way we do right now then . it s already polarizing . the government has defaulted to the majority excuse exclusively . what happens when that s no longer the case ? we ll see , but with a majority who support lgbt rights , the ones pushing for it will have far more leverage . but that s likely way past any of our lifetimes . nah , i see that happening in 15 20 years given how accelerated the shifts are . it was 80 opposed to repealing 377a just 15 years ago . the number is 44 in 2022 . those numbers are actually very similar for same sex marriage too . it s not surprising , the ones who support repealing 377a would also support the latter . the road to civil unions is going to be super long and hard in the first place . if it s left up to parliament , then it becomes a numbers game . if a majority supports it , the opposition will capitalize on it , especially if the pap remains opposed . a the conservatives will be happy with this as a compromise and b whether they have any power to influence making such a move too . b is all that matters . i don t see how they ll maintain as much power if they lose their majority . one step at a time man . no one s saying otherwise , but why should separate but equal be the end game ?

you ve just associated homosexuality with pedophilia and admitted to being anti lgbt .,"part 2 the back then is present , which is why your nus and bishan gay examples won t work . if you ask me to think of homosexual sex crimes that happened 20 30 years ago , legitimately and honestly in the name of the gods i believe in i swear that i can only think of the catholic priests scandal , and i can see how someone else might be only able to think of the same scandal as well . regarding your point about how a local example would be more poignant , yes , i already admitted that its not the best example , but nonetheless it is an example and you can t blame someone for thinking of the church scandals as the first example they can remember . back then is subjective , and to me it includes events that happened 10 20 years back . bishan gay was a meme from at least 2003 https singaporeuncensored . com story of a bishan pedophile gay molester back then we had no smart phones . back then we watched tv instead of youtube back then we had friendster . furthermore , like i said , if op was talking about pedophile cases or abuse of authority i could see how the catholic church could come to mind , but homosexuality ? find me a result on google with the search terms catholic sex abuse that has the word homsexual in it and compare it to the number of articles that don t . if you re going to attack the catholic church , at least get your facts right . the john jay university report remember , commissioned by a catholic institution , stated that 81 percent of the victims in the cases were male . by contrast , victims of child sexual assault are mostly female see david finkelhor s study on this matter . so even though the crux of the matter is pedophilic abuse , don t try to pretend homosexual abuse wasn t a part of the matter as well it absolutely was , considering more than 80 of the victims were male . oh boy , you ve just opened a can of worms and royally screwed yourself over . good luck recovering from this . you ve just associated homosexuality with pedophilia and admitted to being anti lgbt . while it is true that more victims are males , studies have shown that a male pedophile molesting a male victim doesn t mean the offender is homosexual https 1in6 . org get information myths point 4 , a fact exemplified by the lack of the word homosexual in almost every single report regarding the abuse cases . another article to validate the point i am making https www . zeroabuseproject . org victim assistance jwrc keep kids safe sexual offenders 101 sexuality of offenders . infact , the term pedophilia has been so associated when the topic of sexual abuse is brought up , that according to this article https en . m . wikipedia . org wiki debate on the causes of clerical child abuse , the holy see stated that the majority of catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under 18 year olds should not be viewed as pedophiles , but as homosexuals . proving my point that pedophilia is the dominant term associated with the sex abuse cases and not homosexuality . the same article says that the move angered many gay rights organizations and sex abuse victims groups , who claimed it was an attempt by the vatican to redefine the church s past problems with pedophilia as problems with homosexuality . , and you are precisely doing this by trying to associate the problems of sex abuse within the church with homosexuality . so stop pretending that it is a homosexual problem when it isn t , or are you really also anti lgbt ? here s a other quote from the article margaret smith , a john jay college criminologist who worked on the report , pointed out that it is an unwarranted conclusion to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay . though the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature . . . participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man . she further stated that the idea of sexual identity should be separated from the problem of sexual abuse . . . . a t this point , we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now . 21 studies aside , virtually none of the articles regarding the church s scandals even contain the word homosexual . in retrospect , this was because the media reports were purposely trying to avoid associating the lgbt community with the scandals . at the very least , you are defending someone who is knowingly or unknowingly making an anti lgbt statement and i suggest you reconsider the point you are trying to make . are you seriously going to associate homosexuality with pedophilia , despite the scientific proof that they are absolutely exclusive ? be very careful about your reply , because you could be perpetuating the lie that homosexuality is associated with pedophilia , something you , and the person you are defending , have been doing in your previous replies . as for your second main point , i already showed you how to find the original comment . the commenter was trying to disprove the original posters claim that back then , man didn t need to beware other man , by giving an example of how back then , man did need to beware of other man because homosexual assault isn t new finding the original comment doesn t matter now as i have already shown , with quotes , how you ve responded in defence of why would a guy want to look at another guy when he has the same body parts in two different posts . next time you decide to defend a cheap shot against the catholic church , i suggest you get your facts right and think carefully about whether or not you want to dig a hole you can t climb out of . your options now are literally to admit you were wrong in defending the association of homosexuality with pedophilia , proving my point that the church has absolutely nothing to do with the topic , or continue to defend and perpetuate a scientifically proven anti lgbt lie that the gay rights community is upset about .

" former chief justice chan sek keong calls for review of section 377a , says law is outdated singapore former chief justice chan sek keong has called for the constitutional validity of section 377a , which criminalises sexual acts between men , to be reviewed ."," former chief justice chan sek keong calls for review of section 377a , says law is outdated singapore former chief justice chan sek keong has called for the constitutional validity of section 377a , which criminalises sexual acts between men , to be reviewed . he made the call in a paper titled equal justice under the constitution and section 377a of the penal code which was published online by the singapore academy of law journal on monday oct 14 . advertisement advertisement in his paper , mr chan notes that section 377a criminalises acts of gross indecency between males , whether homosexual or bisexual , but not similar acts between males and females , or between females . he asked whether such unequal treatment violated the fundamental rights of all to equality before the law and equal protection under the law , as provided for under article 12 1 of the constitution . laws differentiating based on sex or gender must have a rational basis , he said , giving the example of parliament hypothetically passing a law against women smoking cigars . if parliament bans women , but not men , from smoking cigars , equality of all persons under article 12 1 requires the state to justify the reasonableness of the ban , said mr chan . advertisement advertisement this could be done on health grounds , if medical research showed women were more prone to lung cancer than men , for example . however , if this were based on parliament finding women smoking cigars undignified or unseemly , the courts would have to consider whether such a reason was legitimate , he argued . citing the case of lim meng suang who launched a legal bid against the constitutionality of section 377a in 2013 mr chan noted the judge at the time had upheld the law on the grounds that its purpose was to criminalise male homosexual conduct , as such behaviour was not acceptable or desirable here . however , the former chief justice noted that section 377a was in fact enacted in 1938 to strengthen laws against male prostitution , which was rife according to crime reports at the time and posed serious problems to law and order , public morality and wholesome government . section 377a was enacted for this purpose , and not because male homosexuality per se was unacceptable in singapore society , he said . the law , he argued , was a product of specific social conditions that have long ceased to exist here . mr chan described section 377a as an outlier in singapore s criminal law regime , and the only genuine gender specific offence in our criminal laws . government sees no legitimate state purpose in enforcement while section 377 under which carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animals was an offence was repealed in 2007 under amendments to the penal code , section 377a was retained . the decision not to repeal was based on the misapprehension that the section covered penetrative sex , a hallmark of male homosexuality , he said . parliament reaffirmed the wrong purpose , he added . furthermore , the decision not to repeal section 377a did not affirm its purpose , said mr chan . he noted mps at the time were not asked to vote on it as the government had already decided well before the parliamentary sitting that it would not repeal section 377a , but at the same time not enforce it . the decision not to enforce section 377a with respect to consensual male penetrative sex in private can be seen as a repudiation of its legitimacy , he said , adding it implies the government sees no legitimate state purpose in criminalising or prosecuting male homosexual conduct . the 1938 purpose became invalid in the eyes of the government in 2007 , he stated . the court must interpret section 377a in a way that does not violate the constitution , which depends on the nature of its inconsistency with article 12 1 , said mr chan . if the original purpose of section 377a no longer exists , it can be construed to conform to the constitution by reading it as a gender neutral provision that criminalises non penetrative sex of gross indecency committed in public , he added . court challenges to 377a to be heard in november the views of mr chan , who served as attorney general ag between 1992 and 2006 together with those of other former ags such as v k rajah and walter woon , as well as current deputy ag hri kumar nair are being cited by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt rights activist roy tan , who filed a challenge against the constitutionality of section 377a in court in september . dr tan , a retired general practitioner who helped organise the first pink dot event in 2009 , is one of three people who have filed court challenges against section 377a since last year . the other two are disc jockey mr johnson ong ming and mr bryan choong , former executive director of lgbt non profit organisation oogachaga . all three cases will be

"legislation the panellists also touched on the question of whether lgbtq individuals can be equals in singapore without legislative changes , such as the repeal of section 377a of the penal code that criminalises consensual sex between men ."," the second of today s live webinar series on nov 19 looks into the topic of youth attitudes towards lgbtq issues a researcher on the panel said that while people are tolerant of friends or co workers in same sex relationships , they apply other values such as their moral views on family a gay panellist who helms a podcast said that there needs to be accurate representation of lgbtq individuals in the media it is not possible for everyone to come to a consensus on lgbtq issues , but there must be a willingness to talk , he added singapore young singaporeans are less accepting of family members having same sex relationships than they are of their friends and colleagues as they apply different values on both groups . while they apply tolerance on their co workers , other values such as their notions of morality or the traditional family unit come into play when dealing with a family member . researcher mathew mathews , who was speaking during a today live webinar on friday nov 19 , said so in my family setting , i would want that value to operate . i need people to live within a certain kind of boundary . dr mathews , who heads the social lab at the national university of singapore s institute of policy studies , was commenting on the findings of the today youth survey 2021 . the survey , which polled 1 , 066 respondents between the ages of 18 and 35 in early october , found that more than 70 per cent of respondents were willing to accept friends or work alongside those having same sex relationships , but 58 per cent were willing to accept family members who do so . relating his personal experience , another panellist on the webinar , mr yeo sam jo , said that the difference in attitudes towards friends or family members who are homosexual could also stem from a place of concern . mr yeo , who helms the sg boys podcast that discusses gay issues , said that when he finally told his parents last year that he was gay , his mother expressed concern over whether he would face discrimination at work or be treated differently by people due to his sexual orientation . i can t speak for why there is a discrepancy in the survey results as a whole but if you go by a case by case basis , i think a lot of it really boils down to the stigma of the lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and queer lgbtq identity , he said . friday s webinar was streamed at 8pm on today s instagram and tiktok accounts . the topic for the second instalment of this year s four part webinar series was on youth attitudes on lgbtq issues . the event was moderated by cna presenter elizabeth neo and also featured today s supervising editor yasmine yahya as a panellist . media portrayal of lgbtq community the panellists of the webinar also discussed the portrayal of lgbtq individuals in the media . today s survey found that a third of the respondents 33 per cent felt that the community was positively portrayed , while almost half 46 per cent were neutral about it . about a fifth 22 per cent said that the portrayals were negative . on this , mr yeo said that it was not just enough to have representation of lgbtq individuals on screen , but also have accurate portrayals that did not dehumanise , rely on tropes or portray such individuals in a negative light . he cited the example of the chinese language drama series , my guardian angels , which aired on mediacorp s channel 8 last april . the series had faced criticism for featuring a paedophile character who molested teenage boys and had sexually transmitted diseases as well as a character who was worried about the sexual orientation of her son . mediacorp had apologised last july for causing offence and distress , and reiterated that there was no intention to depict the lgbtq community in a negative light in the series . such portrayals perpetuated stereotypes of the lgbtq community , such as how gay people spread sexually transmitted diseases and are sexual predators , mr yeo said . as individuals with aspirations and dreams , members of the lgbtq community would appreciate positive portrayals in the media , he added . on the portrayal of lgbtq issues in the news media , ms yasmine said that today is still navigating its way on how to report such issues fairly without flouting laws on how they could be portrayed . today has thus tried to centre the community s voice in an accurate , fair and non judgemental way in the hope that reports on lgbtq issues will be read by the wider public , she said . legislation the panellists also touched on the question of whether lgbtq individuals can be equals in singapore without legislative changes , such as the repeal of section 377a of the penal code that criminalises consensual sex between men . to this , ms yasmine said that only time will tell if there will be legal changes in singapore , but in the meantime , individuals can create safe spaces for lgbtq persons in their work settings , social spaces or at home . mr yeo said that even if section 377a is repealed , mindsets about the lgbtq community , such as how it is here to tear apart the fabric of society , must also change . if anything , we are all for stability and cohesion as well . we want to be part of this society as much as you are . we want to feel like we belong . building consensus ms neo asked the panel about the concerns of people in society who are opposed to the normalisation of lgbtq issues . dr mathews said that it stems from how people frame the idea of a family . these segments of the population have questions about an alternative way of running a family , whether it would be viable and its impact on children of homosexual families . on whether different segments of society will ever reach a consensus on lgbtq issues , ms yasmine said that it is not possible to convert everybody . drawing parallels with the feminist movement , she said that there will always be pushback from society whenever progress is made . however , society must keep fighting for change while trying to reach across the divide and build bridges between groups who have opposing views , she added . agreeing , mr yeo said that it is not possible to force someone to agree in something they do not believe . however , it is important that the different groups are mature and open minded enough to listen and be receptive to what the other side is saying . he added if there s no willingness to sit down and have a proper discussion , then the battle is already lost .

org resource denied work an audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in singapore," but conversely , there is no need for affirmative action as imo , it is very insulting as it implies that they have to resort to policies , rather than their own efforts , to be selected . affirmative action is meant to counter inequality . if you accept that lgbtq people are currently discriminated against and not treated equally , it would thus make sense to be in favour of affirmative action to even out the playing field . for example , say xiao hua is a trans woman with qualifications that would otherwise give her 50 chance of getting an interview . she applies to 10 companies . if she wasn t trans , she would likely get 5 interviews . however , 8 out of the 10 companies refuse to hire trans people . so out of the remaining 2 who treat everyone fairly , she only gets 1 interview , and thus overall loses out compared to her equally or less qualified non trans peers . however , say those 2 other companies engaged in affirmative action that prioritise hiring lgbtq people , and give them lower barriers to entry . this would mean that she stands a better chance at getting 2 interviews instead of 1 . it s still much less than the 5 that she is actually qualified for , but every bit helps . ultimately , the goal would be to eradicate discrimination so that lgbtq people have the same chances as everyone else to get hired based on their ability , and when that happens , there would be no more need for that affirmative action . this doesn t say anything about lgbtq people s own efforts , because when the status quo is discriminatory , only the very best performers stand a chance at achieving what the average person does . which is good for those people , but it still leaves average or below average lgbtq performers struggling in ways that their non lgbtq peers do not have to . on a tangent if anyone is interested , the asia pacific transgender network found that employment discrimination against trans people was worst in singapore compared to malaysia , vietnam and thailand overall , our data indicated that the worst discrimination against trans people was in singapore , with trans women and trans men affected to a similar extent . cis applicants there were 81 . 5 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response 76 . 5 percent more likely for cis women and 90 percent for cis men , and 107 . 2 percent more likely to get invited to interview , more than double 112 . 5 percent for cis women and 100 percent for cis men . they also elsewhere noted that for trans female applicants , some of those interviews turned out to be sexual solicitations . source https weareaptn . org resource denied work an audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in singapore ",17-11-2022 10:49,Reddit,gender identity,-1

i have given you a link already from aware where a male sex assault victim has mentioned how 377a frightened him into not pursuing the case .," 1st off , you re such a hypocrite . a successful male orgasm releases not just semen , but serotonin too . anyone who claims not to enjoy the serotonin release is not being honest with himself , or a proper psychopath . how is it being a hypocrite ? also , just because you orgasm doesn t mean you enjoy it such as in cases of rape . it is not wise to insist that orgasm mean the person enjoyed it as it can be forcefully brought out through specific stimulation of erogenous regions . couple of times during primary school . 377a wasn t even part of the consideration , it s more traditional male toxicity . and do you speak for everyone ? i have given you a link already from aware where a male sex assault victim has mentioned how 377a frightened him into not pursuing the case . i ve no issues against equal rights . but wouldn t the striking down of it , emboldened homosexual harassment ? how does it embolden homosexual harassment ? please explain and provide evidences to support this claim . there is nothing that would do so , given that sexual harassment is against the law regardless of gender . in fact , it would lower it by making victims less scared of approaching the police for help . dear , some of us do suffer worse fates . and if some are worse , the others don t get to fight for equal rights ? just be honest and state that you don t like lgbtq people . i ll respect you more for owning your bigotry than your current sealioning . i fear conversion therapy for enjoying it too much . by most accounts , guys give better blowjobs . since the equipment is intrinsically understood . you have horribly misunderstood conversion therapy if you assume it s just getting a blowjob from a guy . and if you truly believe in conversion therapy , you would do it on yourself . after all , you don t seem to want to give lgbtq people a choice and instead want to convert them if you think being lgbtq is a nuture issue . here you re complaining about western imports . there your opponents are complaining about western imports too . guess it all comes with the free port internet . surprise ! lgbtq was prevalent in asia . we had homosexual emperors in china , the bugis had 5 genders , and bisexuality is probably pretty common in china with the whole sworn brothers thing going on . all these stopped after christianity was imported over , while the spread of islam in parts of asia contributing to it too . but not keen about this sexual identity revolution making it down to our schools . which is eventually needed , to change general mindsets . what kind of sexual identity revolution are you talking about . stop creating boogeymen to hide your bigotry of wanting lgbtq people to be invisible . looking at the discrimination biblical jews christians faced . which is why it is disappointing that they have turned it around to bully others . it obviously doesn t matter to me , much as it does you . this actually makes things worse given that arguing for the discrimination and oppression of your fellow citizen is happening because you just want a distraction . as for the btos the rest of the equal rights , it s obviously unfair . but is it any fairer to demand that your priorities , are others too ? so what would you call fair ? the barring of specific groups of citizens from affordable housing for something they re born as ? just because it allows others to benefit from it ? so start trading support . can be anything from womens rights , to death penalty abolishment drugs decriminalisation . and you seem to be ignorant of the fact that we already do so . lgbtq organizations have repeatedly spoken up on womens rights , death penalty abolishment , migrant workers treatment , and so on . so even you don t support a public referendum on this issue . just expect various political parties to risk more votes for less votes , dying on your hill . that s a beautifully principled stance , good luck with that ! go ahead with a public referendum on your rights first . why not start a twitter poll or a poll here on reddit to see which of your rights should be stripped . after all , if you are ok with it happening to others , you should be ok with it happening to yourself .

trans women using the male toilets get harassed a lot .,"i agree that people may be uncomfortable , but safety is more important . trans women using the male toilets get harassed a lot . some get beaten up or molested . overseas they have been raped or killed . so usually that s not an option once they have started transitioning and looking less male . unisex toilets aren t always available , which is why sometimes the female toilets are the safest option for them . but in that scenario , it s also not realistic that they would just walk in brazenly , because the whole reason for avoiding the male toilets is not to draw attention to themselves . hence the issue is how to manage that discomfort for both the trans person and others there , like by having friends come along , or having more unisex toilets , instead of forcing them to only use the male toilets where they could be in danger . with time , that discomfort will also go away once more people get to know more trans people . i had that same discomfort too , but at this point i ve met hundreds of other trans people in sg , and they re just people . one of them did sexually harass me , while also being really trans and not pretending . i ve also been sexually harassed by non trans women , including one aunty with mental health issues who stalked me for months , which is why i don t consider someone s gender the best way to figure out if they re a potential sex predator .

there are multiple cut off points when it comes to kids who express symptoms of gender dysphoria finding out if this is a matter of interests or identity .,"the medical criteria for puberty blockers for trans youths requires a long lasting and intense gender dysphoria , though i m not sure how long they mean . i understand the unfortunate trauma of the permanent effects of puberty . but won t puberty blockers have the same effect , just on the other end of the spectrum . it wouldn t , because puberty blockers delay those permanent changes rather than cause them . it s also the opposite of a life long decision . not going on blockers would be a life long decision , as would going on hormone therapy . gender identity is a complex structure . kids may be non hetero normative but that may not translate to wanting to change their body . i agree , and those kids are unlikely to be given blockers to begin with . there are multiple cut off points when it comes to kids who express symptoms of gender dysphoria finding out if this is a matter of interests or identity . e . g . is this a boy who simply prefers feminine interests and gets upset when he s denied them ? what happens when he s allowed to play with whatever he wants and dress however he likes ? if he s satisfied with that , then this is a gender non conforming kid , and is statistically likely to grow up to be gay . no further action is needed . but if that is not enough and being allowed to wear dresses or play with barbies doesn t seem to address the problem at all , with the kid still being very upset at being called a boy , and wanting to be a girl and have a girls name , with no other foreseeable causes e . g . perhaps the kid has a sister who is treated favourably , then chances are that this is a trans girl . perhaps parents can try out using a more feminine name nickname , and changing other specific sources of distress using a harm reduction approach . this may involve a full social transition . the kid may or may not grow up to be a trans woman . or perhaps like the person you mentioned , they may fluctuate between feeling male or female . as puberty approaches , if some of that prior distress starts returning due to fear over the upcoming changes , and the child explicitly expresses not wanting a male body but a female one , then puberty blockers becomes a consideration . this requires another assessment to reconfirm the gender dysphoria diagnosis , as well as to see if there are other mental health conditions which may cause an issue . if the dysphoria is tolerable , they may choose to wait until the child is older and or it becomes intolerable . they may choose to go through puberty first and only go on blockers or hrt a few years later in their teens , depending on how they feel then . but if the distress is acute , like if the kid s gender identity is unambiguous , they re crying every day and attempting to cut off their genitals with scissors , then blockers would be recommended . there was a report floating around a few years ago that showed that not all diagnosed trans children desire puberty blockers of those who do , not all are assessed to be suitable for treatment of those who are , not all choose to undergo treatment . the cost itself can be a significant deterrent , because it s about usd 1 , 500 a month . either way , it s not something that s simply given to kids if they express any symptoms of gender dysphoria . treatment for trans youths is focused on harm reduction and doing things step by step to resolve gender dysphoria , with medical intervention being the last resort when it is actively requested and other measures aren t sufficient . minimum age for hrt in singapore is 21 without parental consent , though . 17 with parental consent . and that can definitely be lowered because it s only pushing a lot of desperate trans youths to the black market , since by 21 most changes are irreversible and will stay with them for life .

if you asked any practitioner of abrahamic religions even a hundred years ago , they d tell you it s objectively fair for women to be expected to stay at home and be a good wife , for it is their god ordained role . who s to say future generations would not look upon what we think of as objectively fair and scoff ? it s not even a straight march towards more liberalism . some ancient civilisations such as rome viewed homosexuality more liberally than many western civilisations in the 20th century , for example ! this moral objectivist belief , in its modern form , can often be linked to the colonial mindset and the white man s burden , so it s a little amusing to see a singaporean espousing this . https plato . stanford . edu entries moral relativism nonetheless , the increased awareness of moral diversity especially between western and non western cultures on the part of europeans in the modern era is an important antecedent to the contemporary concern with moral relativism . during this time , the predominant view among europeans and their colonial progeny was that their moral values were superior to the moral values of other cultures . even if we believe in that , it s a massive leap of faith to think that the government always knows better , especially when it comes to human rights ! what was the right thing to do in those cases ? the right thing to do is to find out what the people want , and do it . which countries ? plenty of countries like the us , germany and canada disprove your narrative . are they less democratic than singapore ? i literally listed a few examples of countries that require referendum for constitutional amendments . please read . also , why would those countries be less democratic than singapore simply because they follow the same practice of allowing constitutional amendment purely via legislation ? at most , you can conclude that they re roughly equally democratic , though even that is quite a stretch because this is but one measure of democracy . refer above . that s not the only way to do so . i also see no mention of a referendum in denmark s case . no one said referendum is the only way . it s the more democratic way . also , re . denmark https constitutional change . com recent constitutional revision debate in denmark furthermore , in 2009 the danish act of succession was amended in order to introduce gender equality . this amendment could only be carried out by following the procedure for changing the constitution . this procedure is very comprehensive and includes a referendum in which a majority of those voting and at least 40 percent of all those entitled to vote must vote in favor of the proposed amendments . this criterion is hard to fulfill and gender equality as regards succession to the throne has always been mentioned as a popular question which could be used to engage the voters in a general revision of the constitution . however , this opportunity was bypassed as the politicians only initiated an amendment of the act of succession . this raised some public debate and some voters voted against the amendment in order to show their protest against the fact that no steps were taken towards a general revision of the constitution . why would i assume when polls exist on the issue of lgbt rights ? polls that show opinions shifting significantly even in the last 5 years , and suggest that a majority of singaporeans might support same sex marriage soon ? https en . wikipedia . org wiki lgbt rights in singapore according to the past few years of polling according to 2013 polling , some 75 of singaporeans opposed same sex marriage . in 2019 , a poll conducted by yougov with 1 , 033 respondents showed that about one third 34 of singaporeans backed same sex partnerships , while 43 opposed their legalization , and the remaining 23 were uncertain . a 2019 poll conducted by the institute of policy studies found that opposition to same sex marriage in singapore had fallen to 60 , down from 74 in 2013 . the poll also found that nearly six in ten singaporeans aged between 18 and 25 believed same sex marriage is not wrong . what gives you moral high ground over those you disagree with anyway ? why do you think you re better ? who do you think you are , to believe you have the right to bulldoze over what others believe in and push through with what you want , instead of actually trying to be an activist for your beliefs and trying to change minds ? ergo rule of the majority , because clearly those of the lgbt community or even our youth are being ignored by continuing with this status quo . and as such , other political parties mostly wp that are willing to cater more to these groups are gaining political prominence , forcing the pap to respond ! anyway , it is true . minorities often need allies from majority demographics to tilt the scales in their favour . that s why , for example , blm allies are such a prominent part of the movement in the us . this is the nature of the beast , however it is still better than the alternative , which are political systems where no one s rights are being looked after except for a small minority aristocrats , ruling class , etc . , depending on system . your perceived alternative is to rely on benevolent undemocratic rulers . that is not really viable long term . even the most benevolent party can be corrupted by those seeking power , and while democracy is often sub optimal compared to the hypothetical benevolent dictator , it s a relatively stable system over the longer term . benevolent dictators may or may not manage their succession well , and it is very possible for power to slip into the wrong hands over a few generations . through elections and voting for their representatives . it certainly doesn t mean that their representatives have to do everything that citizens want . literally no democracy works that way . of course , not everything representatives do reflect what people want . we re still talking about rights , right ? rights aren t minor pieces of regulation like the day to day regulatory powers of mas . no one really cares enough to use their political power as a citizen to influence that unless they work in the industry or if something goes seriously wrong eg . us in 2009 and dodd frank , a remarkably popular piece of financial legislation . we re talking about rights that are enshrined in the constitution here . constitutional amendments should involve the citizenry , and often do , even in countries that do not require referendum . that it doesn t happen in singapore is actually kinda ridiculous , and is one of the reasons a supermajority in parliament is harmful .

"their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family ."," government considering best way forward on 377a , will respect different viewpoints shanmugam court s decision consistent with past position on 377a mr shanmugam noted that successive court judgments over the years have consistently taken the position that these are highly contentious social issues and within the province of parliament . the heterosexual stable family remains a stable norm , he added . the current legal position reflects our society s norms , values and attitudes . that s what the courts have said . in its judgment , the court noted that the compromise which singapore has struck , in respect to section 377a , is unique , said mr shanmugam . our approach strikes a balance between preserving the legislative status quo , whilst accommodating the concerns of those directly affected by the legislation . the court recognised that the government did this in order to avoid driving a deeper wedge within our society , he added . it also noted that singapore s approach seeks to keep what to do with section 377a within the democratic space . socially charged issues , such as section 377a , call for continued discussion and open ended resolution within the political domain , where we can forge consensus , rather than in win lose outcomes in court . in this way , we can accommodate divergent interests , avoid polarisation and facilitate incremental change , said mr shanmugam . additionally , the court highlighted the importance of creating space for peaceful co existence among various groups , especially since the balance between the various interests around section 377a has grown more delicate . these opinions align with the approach that the government has taken in dealing with section 377a , and that it intends to take as it considers the changes in our social landscape since 2007 . in 2007 , prime minister lee hsien loong said in parliament , when the penal code was amended but section 377a left unchanged , that we want to be a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values , but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society , said mr shanmugam . mr lee had added that among them are some of our friends , our relatives , our colleagues , our brothers and sisters , or some of our children , and said homosexual individuals are our kith and kin . this remains our stand today , added mr shanmugam . our emphases on gradual evolution and on traditional families remain constant . shifting attitudes towards homosexuality however , since the issue was last discussed in parliament in 2007 , social attitudes towards homosexuality have gradually shifted , mr shanmugam acknowledged . one of the things that upsets the lgbt community is that many feel that their experience of being hurt or rejected by their families , friends , schools , companies is not recognised , indeed often denied . at the same time , a large majority want to preserve the overall tone of our society , said mr shanmugam . in particular , the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman , and that children should be raised within such a family structure . their concern is not section 377a per se , but the broader issues of marriage and family . many among this group , also support decriminalising homosexual sex between men . both these viewpoints are valid and important , he added . live and let live approach noting that these are deeply divisive issues , mr shanmugam said that is why the government takes a live and let live approach . we seek to be an inclusive society , where mutual respect and tolerance for different views and practices are paramount . government has thus taken the approach that while section 377a remains on the books , there will be no proactive enforcement . and agc takes a similar approach . mr shanmugam added that the government had expressly included in the mrha maintenance of religious harmony act that any attack on lgbt groups , or on persons because they are lgbt , will be an offence , and won t be tolerated . lgbt individuals are entitled to live peacefully , without being attacked or threatened , he said . likewise , any attack on any other group , based on their religion , or religious beliefs , even if those beliefs run counter to values held by lgbt groups will not be acceptable . 1 . 0 . 2 source code https github . com fterh sneakpeek contribute https github . com fterh sneakpeek ",03-03-2022 16:08,Reddit,377a,0

"stigma can happen in very subtle ways , even if the gay marriage is legal on paper .","1 . yes , op didn t ask for acceptance from every person . however op did talked about the general acceptance of the alt lifestyle as also another normal , from both the workforce and family before moving onto the equality part . quote while 377a is not strictly enforced , it is still in place to preserve traditional family values . we want acceptance from our parents and not have the fear of getting kicked out of the house . we have to be recognised as husbands wives without having the fear that our sexuality will affect our career especially for those in the govt sector . unquote in the last quoted sentence , op seem to imply that the legal effect of gay marriage law will eliminate the fear of their sexuality affecting their career . it is simply not true . stigma can happen in very subtle ways , even if the gay marriage is legal on paper . 2 . op did mention about education . quote and it sucks because of the lack of education about sexuality in singapore . no teachers or adults ever talked about it . unquote there seem to be a suggested frustration towards our current curriculum not being accepting other genders hence it is unable to help confused youngsters come to terms with their ssa . also , if the 377a is repealed , the next step is to legalize gay marriage . absolutely right because it is naturally the next step . now if you have already legalize the act between same sex as well as marriage , shouldn t you also be teaching about the different genders in school as part of sex ed ? how can you accept gay marriage but not change sex ed ? isn t that tantamount to discrimination , no ? on the law level you accept other genders , but in school you don t ? does that make sense ? wouldn t not changing sex ed to accommodate other genders be equivalent to being homophobic ? this is the line of thought . am i jumping the gun ? nope because that s how it was done in the west . it is not logical to only stop at gay marriage . it is the natural road of progression . to say you accept same sex union without changing school curriculum to educate the younger singaporeans on other genders is almost like you look into the mirror , only to forget how you look like after you walk away . 3 . op was using a bible verse to justify how if we love someone , we should accept them as who they are , to which i quoted another bible verse that said about correcting someone whom you love . i was just trying to put that neighbor love into context . that love also includes loving discipline . nothing about correcting anybody . like how a mother would correct a wayward son not because she hates him , but because she loved him . love does not equate full acceptance was the point i was trying to bring up . 4 . well it clearly make difference when it comes to acquiring hdbs and marriage etc . but since op was on the topic of acceptance , it does not make a difference because stigma will still be there anyways . so we repeal 377a ? coz it helps them get hdbs and a proper marriage license ? sounds good . but again , what about point 2 ? it doesn t just stop there . it is not logical . as i have brought up about the gender less toilet in my earlier post , that is also a part of the logical progression . since there are more than just two genders , how can we discriminate the other genders by only having just two gendered toilets ? if the school teaches about multiple genders , why aren t the toilets showing more than two genders ? it happened in the us and children got sexually assaulted by men identifying as female in toilets . all of these will eventually intrude into the lives of the majority because it affects everyone . and you cannot impose the preference of the minorities at the expense of the majority . as for the issue on hdb , well it can be resolved by renting an apartment outside , until you reach the age of 35 . there s no systematic oppression in singapore . homosexuals have their safe space here . they don t get sentenced to jail just for being homosexuals like in the middle east . they get to host pink dot every year without police arresting them and government stopping the event . so things are fine as they are . hence , for the reasons mentioned above , i support 377a . its more than just hdbs and marriage acceptance or even society acceptance . i genuinely hope everyone here at the very least do their own research and look into what happened after gay marriage was passed in other countries . look into facts . not those sensational headlines . if after looking into all of that , you still disagree with me , thats fine with me . really . all i just hope is that everyone arrive at their stand through evidences , facts and logic instead of emotions .

"mr ravi argued that parliament s stance that section 377a will not be proactively enforced interferes with article 9 1 of the constitution , as it leads to an inconsistent and arbitrary application of criminal procedure as well as being incongruous with the mandatory obligation under section 424 of the cpc ."," sexual orientation cannot be wilfully changed , say lawyers fighting to repeal section 377a singapore sexual orientation cannot be wilfully changed and is a product of genetic and environmental factors , said lawyers arguing for the repeal of section 377a of the penal code . they argued that the law , which criminalises acts of gross indecency between men , violates article 9 of the constitution guaranteeing the right to life and personal liberty , and article 14 guaranteeing freedom of expression . the legal team , consisting of mr eugene thuraisingam , mr suang wijaya and mr johannes hadi of the eugene thuraisingam law firm , represented disc jockey johnson ong ming in the high court on monday nov 18 in the second of three cases to be brought against section 377a this month . the attorney general s chambers agc has been listed as the respondent in all of the cases . mr ong s lawyers presented expert evidence from six medical professionals to back up their claims , including three called by mr ong and three called by the agc . those called by mr ong were british psychiatrist dinesh bhugra , a professor of mental health and diversity at the institute of psychiatry at king s college london dr jacob rajesh , a senior consultant psychiatrist at the promises clinic in novena medical centre and american public health and epidemiology professor chris beyrer of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health . those called by the agc were dr cai yiming , an emeritus consultant in the department of developmental psychiatry at the institute of mental health retired geneticist john tay sin hock , who was the former head of division of human genetics at the national university of singapore and dr derrick heng mok kwee , group director of the public health group in the ministry of health . the experts on both sides largely agree that sexual orientation cannot be wilfully changed and that biological factors such as one s genes and non social environmental factors such as exposure to different levels of hormones in the womb are contributors to one s sexual orientation , the lawyers argued . there is also no credible scientific evidence that therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation , such as reparative or conversion therapy , is safe or effective , they added . but the experts differed on whether choice and social environmental factors like culture play a role in determining sexual orientation . dr cai said there is very little we can scientifically conclude about whether there is choice in sexual orientation . related story section 377a was intended to stop british civil servants visiting male prostitutes lawyers dr tay said that genetics may play some part in determining sexual orientation but are not the sole cause of it , suggesting that culture plays a role as well . mr ong s lawyers contended that the scientific literature cited by dr cai contradicted his conclusion . they also argued that dr tay did not cite any evidence to support his conclusion that cultural factors play such a role . it is absurd , irrational and discriminatory to criminalise a person on the basis of his natural , unchangeable identity and for non harmful private acts , the team said in a statement to the media summarising their arguments . the lawyers noted that their case differs from a previous case brought against section 377a in 2010 by mr tan eng hong , whose lawyer had argued that there was overwhelming evidence that a person s sexual orientation is biologically determined . mr tan had provided the court with statements from medical and scientific bodies which were not formally entered as evidence , they said . for the first time , there is expert evidence before the courts on the nature of sexual orientation . in the previous cases , the court was only asked to take judicial notice of scientific facts which required a different legal test , the lawyers said in their statement . the first case , brought by mr bryan choong chee hong , 42 , the former executive director of lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender lgbt non profit oogachaga , was heard last week . the third case , brought by lgbt activist and retired general practitioner tan seng kee , was also heard on monday . related story section 377a moving beyond slippery slopes to a rational consensus related story gay rights will remain one of singapore s most intractable knots mr m . ravi of carson law chambers , who represented dr tan , argued that other laws make it legally obligatory for anyone to report those who violate section 377a , including gay men themselves , their friends or family members , and their medical care providers . for example , section 424 of the criminal procedure code cpc states that every person aware of the commission of or the intention of any other person to commit any arrestable offence punishable under chapter xvi of the penal code , among others , shall report that commission or intention to the police . section 377a falls under chapter xvi of the penal code . mr ravi argued that parliament s stance that section 377a will not be proactively enforced interferes with article 9 1 of the constitution , as it leads to an inconsistent and arbitrary application of criminal procedure as well as being incongruous with the mandatory obligation under section 424 of the cpc . the three cases were heard by justice see kee oon in chambers and were not open to the

the majority that supports retaining 377a is ever shrinking and the asian culture excuse is being chipped away by countries like taiwan and thailand .," that s not guaranteed . of course it s not guaranteed , but it s far more likely the status quo will change in 10 20 years given the rapid shift we re seeing . 36 of respondents , a very significant number , is so apathetic that they wouldn t even give a yes no answer to a possibly anonymised ? survey . if you looked at previous ipsos polls , that just represents the who are neutral about it . when it comes to this , neutrality isn t necessarily bad . so , by and large , singapore might still lack strong political interest in the matter to prompt serious discussion or even change in the near future . i think you re underestimating how accelerated the changes to the status quo becomes as the older generation die out and the younger generation replaces them as voters . even thailand s lawmakers gave initial approval to legalising same sex unions just yesterday . it may not happen in the near future i . e . next 5 years , but there s no way singapore can ignore the issue in 10 20 years . to be honest , singaporeans in general do not have the reputation of strongly supporting social causes . yeah , but you re seeing the younger generation care more about social causes too . all these small shifts add up and snowball over time . without sufficiently strong pressure , especially from a strong core of people with strong opinions on the issue , there is not a lot of political impetus to visit this issue . right , but why do you assume the pressure on parliament to address this issue isn t going to increase moving forwards ? is singapore this magical exception that will escape what happened in other countries with a younger generation that s more progressive ? i find that very doubtful . he swing is definitely not linear that goes from 55 to 44 to 0 in 16 years no , but the swing is more likely to accelerate , notably if you look at trends from other countries . certainly , look at past polls , the shift doesn t look like it s going to lose momentum any time soon . at some point it would plateau due to strong supporters for 377a . except it s going to plateau in favor of repealing 377a . have you seen the breakdown of support oppose by age ? the majority of 30 years olds already support repealing 377a . not only , those with no religions support repealing 377a more than they oppose it , and that group is also growing in singapore . it s not like repeal will be guaranteed to shoot up 8 every 4 years to 50 in 15 years . why not ? that actually has been the trend , give or take a few , with past surveys . really though , at its core , this survey is a strong indication of the fact that the pap s two common excuses are not going to be valid forever . the majority that supports retaining 377a is ever shrinking and the asian culture excuse is being chipped away by countries like taiwan and thailand . that gives you confidence to bet everything on it . this is great news and a bolster for those currently pushing for equal lgbt rights , certainly to keep the momentum going or even to accelerate it . i m absolutely not betting anything on it , but i see a lot of hope for future generations to not have to go through what others like myself have had to .

an example to demonstrate that appealing to authority in the case of transgender research is completely useless . you just appealed to the authority of a court lol . i mean , i guess a court can overrule a medical organization , but if i m looking for which authority is correct about the outcomes of a treatment i d still be appealing to the medical organization . plus the judges made , imo , some glaring errors described below . this case really angered the trans community because funnily enough , the case was brought to court by a 23 year old keira bell who was given blockers at a young age and now regrets it , desists and is suing the nhs for damaging her ability to have children . i d be pretty angry if i or people in my community were suddenly denied medical treatment we needed . it s also a misunderstanding of regret rates . medical regret isn t uncommon e . g 24 . 1 of masectomies https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc3015023 , 18 of knee replacements https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc6961288 . withdrawing treatment for all under 16s for one person regretting starting transition above 16 , the age of medical consent does seem unjust . one trans lawyer deals with some of the philosophical and legal problems here https medium . com empowered trans woman critical thoughts on bell v tavistock 797ca81ed21d . i m guessing that there probably are people looking to overturn the ruling . i ll stick to how i think the judges misinterpreted the studies below 73 the reported qualitative data on early outcomes of 44 young people who received early pubertal suppression . . . noted that there was no overall improvement in mood or psychological wellbeing using standardized psychological measures . emphasis added there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of pbs and what the correct comparison group is . if you receive puberty blockers , it s not expected that your mood improves . you get no unwanted physical changes so your psychological functioning is supposed to be stable . the relevant comparison here is whether if you don t receive blockers , your mood worsens . it s explained in the pb article link above under randomized control trial , to get this data you d need enough patients to consent to not getting pbs , which is unlikely because they are there seeking pbs in the first place . 136 . . . the evidence shows that the vast majority of children who take pbs move on to take cross sex hormones , that stages 1 and 2 are two stages of one clinical pathway and once on that pathway it is extremely rare for a child to get off it . . . to achieve gillick competence the child or young person would have to understand not simply the implications of taking pbs but those of progressing to crosssex hormones . plainly put , this is not what the evidence shows . the court already had several samples of children who take pbs and do not move on to csh , namely children who take pbs for precocious puberty . the text does not mention that pbs did not affect precocious puberty kids gender identities . an obvious interpretation of those numbers is that kids are given pb because the patients , doctors and parents are good at telling if they need pbs or not . and the corollary that if these kids are denied pbs would go on to become increasingly gender dysphoric adults , along with all the psychological difficulties that would result from that , isn t considered . i think the courts are making a mistake , given turban 2020 https pediatrics . aappublications . org content early 2020 01 21 peds . 2019 1725 ?

counsellors , social workers , and community youth workers in from singapore . we were distressed to read about a transgender student 146 s experience of discrimination at her school , including claims that the ministry of education , singapore moe and her school interfered to stop her from receiving the hormone therapy that her doctor advised . in response , moe denied involvement while misgendering her in their statement 16 jan . the student has continued to share her name , ashlee , and further details with the straits times and today . as education and social service professionals , we have witnessed and heard about similar situations faced by transgender students in singapore schools . we apologise for any way in which we may have made transgender and other lgbtq students feel unsafe or unwelcome at school . we want to do better by our young people . we are aware of the evidence that transgender youths face higher risks of depression and suicide when prevented from transitioning . delaying transition is not always an option , especially for students with severe gender dysphoria . it is our duty as school leaders , teachers and counsellors to help them manage the challenges that arise from transitioning at school , not to add to them or look away . we hold moe to their promise that they will 147 work closely with and respect the professional advice given by moh 146 s healthcare professionals 148 . on this basis , we call on the ministry to implement and communicate a clear policy on supporting transgender students at schools , in line with advice from healthcare professionals , and in consultation with the respective students and their families . this policy should include advising school leaders , teachers and counsellors that they should defer to healthcare professionals in all decisions pertaining to a student 146 s physical and mental health , gender presentation , and transition , without interference from school leaders , teachers or counsellors and regardless of their personal preferences or beliefs . there should not be any pressure or interference from the school towards the student or their doctors to either withhold gender transition or to hasten medical procedures e . g . rushing surgeries that would enable the student to change their legal sex . administrative concerns should never take precedence over a student 146 s life , health , education , and well being . as an act of care and respect , school leaders and staff should make efforts to respect the expressed gender of students who have trusted us enough to share their transgender identities . as an extension of that trust , a student s transgender identity should not be revealed to or discussed with their parents without the student s prior consent . there should be no institutional or personal threats made to any student , their family , or their doctors . schools should proactively offer though not mandate supportive counselling and other mental health services to transgender students . these counsellors should not condemn or pressure students to change their gender identities . there should be greater transparency and accountability if any school leaders , teachers or counsellors were to go against these guidelines . we also note that moe 146 s statement advised 147 students who experience unkind behaviour from peers to approach the teachers or school leaders as they are committed to keep students safe 148 . we are unfortunately aware of transgender students who sought help only to be punished as discipline cases , outed to their parents without their consent , or referred to programmes aiming to change their sexual orientation or gender identity . this has kept many others from seeking help out of fear . we call on moe to take action on their words by working to equip schools to create a safe school environment for all students , including transgender students . this could , among other things , take the form of inclusive policies , training for all teachers and counsellors on gender dysphoria and lgbtq issues , inclusive sexuality education and anti bullying programmes , and having a statement of inclusion for schools and counsellors to abide by . many of us were afraid to write this statement or put our names to it because we recognise that it is still not safe for us as individuals and professionals to publicly express these views . nevertheless , we are making this statement because we believe that it is the right thing to do , and because it is our professional duty to protect and care for all

"we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war .","we all know that any developed country outside of sea region and ccp does not criminalised people just becus they are specifically gendered male and have sex with each other . even india does not criminalise . thats blunt sense moronic , to criminalise something specifically based on gender . apologies if you disagree . even india moves on from the ruling many years back . the way you are putting it , its like just because other countries are doing it , we should do it too . so if other countries are abolishing or has already abolished death sentence for drug smugglers , we should blindly follow ? blind following the blind ? with out the independence of mind ? shoudn t the final outsome , even if it results in the abolishment of the act , be made with the indepencence of mind ? at least justifty your support for the abolishment of 377a with better logic . majority of these less developed sea countries will properly side ccp in the upcoming war . so you are really just associating your ideal values with them . since the early 2010s , honestly people all over the globe dont really anti male homo people anymore . why again are you mentioning about the ccp ? they are the only ones against abolishment of 377a like laws ? what about those states where gay sex is punishable by death . quite a few of them around . and they fare worse then ccp in terms of gay rights . but no mention of it from you . but just solely on ccp . i wonder why . we are on the topic of 377a , not the upcoming war . so you are spilling over your dislike of ccp in regards to those matters to this ? if you really feel that homosexuality is immoral for the sake of so called moral values , you wouldn t even criminalise just male people , male people specifically were targeted because people who make these rules are mostly male people and are just over paranoid that without these laws and ruling , they themselves will turn homosexual . there is a term called homophobia , this is what you sound like more rather than people preaching good people values . the part in bold , that s one of the worst logic i ever heard . i mean serious ? can see you are no longer logical . not sure what you are smoking there . what next ? law makers are coming are with anti robbery laws because they are afraid they might become robbers themselves ? then they might as well not have the law and enjoy themselves by making it legal fulfilling their desires or tendencies legallly rather then fighting against their innate desires , why go through all the trouble ? as for the homesexuality part being immoral . not sure why you brought up the immoral part . a celibate homosexual is more moral than a promiscuous hetereosexual . a better way to put it is , its against nature rather then immoral . heterosexuality is part of human evolution in terms of the continuance of human population . not to mention , those body parts when in unison , were not mean to perform those task , which is why proportionally there is a higher risk of contracting stds , hiv , monkeypox , suffering from incontinence etc . in gays then heterosexuals . . because nature did not mean those body parts for that . which is why i support maintaining status quo not further tightening of the law . by that , i mean the law existing in name to permeate the state of mind that gay sex is discouraged , even though the act was no longer stricly enforced while not actually in most cases punishing gay sex itself . which is i believe the most popular sentiment among the general population excluding lgbts it would have been better to strengthen or come up protective laws against depriving gays , lgbts who are out of the closet , of job opportunities , etc . rather then repealing the act . problems is , there are people like you who like to jump to conclusions . not supporting the repealing of the act gays should be punished heavily or homophobia blah blah . of course i am not ruling out the existence of such people . but there are different schools of thought even among those who do not support the repealing of the act . some take a more aggressive stance , some take a more middle ground . regarding good values , you have good values because you support repealing of the act ? seems like quite a loose definition of good values if so . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . anyway , i believe the government repeal of 377a is a strategy to boost the international image , attract more international investments , more than an appeal to voters like me . not sure if repealing of the act , but embedding the defintion of marriage only between man and women into the contsitution , making it not challengable in court is exactly boost the international image , attract more international investments that u define . maybe some real experts can advice dont take it personal just becus i dont support the 377a . but im trying to tell you , tbh the way you traditionalists justify 377a , its really silly . . and im not even a pro homo person . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . if you suck at justifying and challenging something people are challenging then just learn to accept the new norms . nah , i don t take it personally . hope you seriously don t too . i am also fine that you are the judge of howthose who dun support repealing of the act are , traditionalists , suck at justifying and challenging , and not being able to accept new norms . after all , delusional or not , your opinions and sentiments must be superior to those that contrast to you and it is the universal truth . and yes , i believe you are not even a pro homo person after reading your post which is not even actually pro homo .

"this approach is actually very impractical in practice given how the required surgeries are extremely expensive about 30k for trans women , 100k for trans men and cannot be covered by insurance , the vast majority of trans people in singapore about 90 , based on a survey of 240 respondents have never managed to change our ics , largely for financial reasons .","this approach is actually very impractical in practice given how the required surgeries are extremely expensive about 30k for trans women , 100k for trans men and cannot be covered by insurance , the vast majority of trans people in singapore about 90 , based on a survey of 240 respondents have never managed to change our ics , largely for financial reasons . most trans people here are also low income and there s a high unemployment rate , which puts it even further out of reach and creates a vicious cycle where having a mismatched ic makes it difficult to get a job since it outs them as trans , which then makes it difficult to afford surgery to change the ic . there is also a high risk of medical risks and complications , especially for trans men who additionally need multiple surgeries over 1 2 years . a local surgeon allegedly has a 1 in 3 fatality rate for trans men . most can t afford the time off work for the months of recovery , and if they have parents or other family members depending on them , they may not want to take the risk . conversely , hormone therapy is much more affordable and is what changes one s external appearance and sexual characteristics . many trans people thus choose to just do that and find it sufficient to alleviate gender dysphoria and allow us to live as our gender . so this means that there is a large number of trans people who look like and live as one sex but are legally another . it s the case for me . i ve been on testosterone for over 10 years and had top surgery . most people in my life including my colleagues only know me as a guy , but my ic says f . it s an administrative nightmare that inconveniences not just me but others . for example , i ve been denied phone banking services because i sound like a guy on the phone but my account says ms and they refused to believe it was me . another time , a covid testing batch was held up when i asked about the delay the nurses said they worried they got the results messed up since my record said i was a female patient , so i explained i was trans . it also makes travelling overseas dangerous , such as to malaysia and indonesia where being trans is illegal , or to the us where anti trans hatred is at a peak and people have guns . on a day to day basis it means repeatedly outing myself whenever i need to show my ic or interact with any institution that lists me as ms , and it s pretty stressful having to repeatedly tell strangers that i m trans , especially when not all of them react well . i know that many people consider surgery a good criteria because when the policy was first set in the 1970s , it was with trans women in mind , and it was often the only form of medical transition that trans people did . but it s been 50 years and there have been many advances in trans healthcare since then , especially with the rise in use of hrt , such that we really need to relook at those policies .

"secondly , the results tally with many more studies of the positive mental health effects of hormone therapy and surgery for trans adults , some of which is objectively measurable e ."," if you look at the democratic party in the usa , they werent always supportive of lgbt community that was the case of the world at large , though , as well as for many people i know , including my parents . views change , especially when someone comes to personally know more lgbt people . the christian church in the us is also an example of that just a few years ago , the vast majority strongly opposed lgbt rights , whereas now more than half are supportive . and what changed wasn t any political agenda to get votes but more lgbt people coming out to their friends and families and making it harder for them to be demonised as a separate group that had nothing to do with normal society . i think it does a great disservice to the work and sacrifices made by countless activists and lgbt people making those personal connections , to dismiss it all as the workings of some insidious political conspiracy just out to get votes . the same democratic party is so keen on championing illegal immigrants to stay in safe city that wont deport them because they represent an untapped voter base those people can t vote . but as i recall when the lgbt movement was young , there were gay members who wanted carnal relationship with a much younger population and they arose from the lgbt movement and started nambla after they got kicked out pedophiles who were attracted to and pursued relationships with boys may have found themselves banding together with gay men in a society that was very hostile towards both groups and considered both to be an expression of aberrant if not criminal sexuality . this doesn t make them gay men nor representative of gay men . the atmosphere back then was also very different even among straight people , a lot of what was considered acceptable sexual behaviour , such as straight men getting women drunk to have sex with them , or grabbing random women to kiss them in bouts of spontaneous passion , would today be recognised as sexual assault . from what i understand , the climate then also meant that a lot of young gay teenagers found themselves kicked out of their homes and left to survive on the streets . many ended up seeking out the gay community for refuge , where older gay men took them under their wing and sometimes ended up in sexual relationships with them . this does not make it acceptable . but i can understand why it happened , and it s also very different from a situation where an adult man knowingly seeks out to exploit a child s innocence by coercing or luring them into a relationship . one reason why pursuing sex with children is so wrong is because it robs them of their innocence . those gay teens lost their innocence long ago . i think many of their adult partners were also not aware that this was wrong , because many were deeply sexually broken and had never had the opportunity to learn otherwise . the only thing they were taught was that all their sexual desires were equally wrong and worthy of punishment . the wider society didn t recognise any distinction between men having sex with men or with boys , and so while i don t condone this in the least , it s to be expected that the men in question likewise did not recognise that distinction . but that has changed , which is why nambla got kicked out . right now , the vast majority of gay men and especially the larger lgbt community recognise the moral repulsiveness of having sex with children , and if anything , they are the primary drivers of the message that consent is crucial to any sexual relationship , and that children and young teens are incapable of giving that consent . the puberty blocker drugs are gnrh agonist hormones which come with significant risk pertaining to suicide , depression and anxiety yeah , i ve heard that , which is what makes it all the more significant that trans youth who go on puberty blockers have remarkably lower rates of suicide , depression and anxiety compared to trans youth who do not receive that treatment . just a cursory look revealed some interesting questions that the articles failed to address such as confounders or that questionaires are generally low tier in the hierarchy of evidence i agree , but firstly when trans youth are almost consistently very depressed , anxious and suicidal except for this one group , it s still the best option if erring on the side of caution the fact that they were even alive after 7 years to do those questionnaires is remarkable in itself . secondly , the results tally with many more studies of the positive mental health effects of hormone therapy and surgery for trans adults , some of which is objectively measurable e . g . stress hormone levels in blood . anecdotally , i m close friends with many trans people and have had casual contact with perhaps over a thousand through my activist work and online trans communities . i ve seen the positive results of transition first hand in both their lives and my own things like friends who used to cry all the time and regularly attempt suicide but then transitioned and are now very happy , haven t cried even once since then , and are living fulfilling lives . these examples are happening over and over again in every single trans person i have personally known , including trans children whose parents i m in touch with . the difference transition including blockers makes is extremely palpable , and while higher tier evidence is understandably required to make conclusions in academic studies , it isn t something that s necessary to recognise the difference between a deeply depressed child and a happy one . while i can understand people wanting more time to do long term studies , it s the best default option for now , given what evidence we have .

i admit the big problem with lgbt rights is that it will open up a can of worms and that a lot of social structures would have to be dismantled and redefined again .,"1 yeah definitely . it is that age where everyone is discovering themselves . i guess the only difference could be that it is more high stakes for lgbt teens . because one is working with the knowledge of our social context of singapore s stance towards such individuals . the fact that sexual relations between individuals of the same sex is illegal . not to mention that our sex education does not really talk about lgbt stuff , so there s a lack of knowledge and support . 2 i don t remember how the conversation went , but i actually asked the mo . it was a follow up appointment while in tekong . i asked him i m in pes c because of my asthma right ? . he said no and told me that . even when my security clearance was rejected , my immediate superior say you didn t get cleared , cause you know ah . before that i was in another branch and the head actually brought me in to talk privately , asking me questions of whether i cross dress etc . and he warned me to not do anything funny . was a humiliating experience tbh , when all i wanted to do is serve and get away from the place 3 the issues here are definitely grounds for greater conversation with the wider society . like you said , it s definitely not an easy issue to tackle . i admit the big problem with lgbt rights is that it will open up a can of worms and that a lot of social structures would have to be dismantled and redefined again . personally , i am more for adoption too . there s still children in the world who deserve a loving family .

"so it s always suspect when people call to deny rights to trans people on the basis of concern about potential sexual assault , when actual sexual assault is not treated with the same level of panic and call to action ."," firstly the spa case is an outlier where the person was trying to make some kind of statement and bait others into outrage . it s not realistic to consider that letting trans people change our gender markers without genital surgery is going to result in this happening , not least because singapore doesn t have that same kind of comfort around nudity . i ve been in both male and female public facilities toilets , locker rooms , showers and have never seen another naked person in my life , other when accidentally walking in on my family while they re changing clothes . with that caveat , to answer your question yes , it makes it easier . in the same way that allowing male teachers makes it more likely for students to be sexually abused allowing teenagers to date without a chaperone makes it easier for them to be raped allowing cars mean that 1 . 3 million people die in traffic accidents every year allowing social gatherings makes it easier for covid to spread and kill people . society is full of those balances where we have agreed to take the risk . it s about how much we value the freedoms , dignity and quality of life that would be lost should we aim for perfect safety . and in this case , maintaining the status quo means denying a vulnerable minority of human dignity and framing us all as potential sex offenders reducible to our genitals , when trans people are significantly more likely to ourselves be victims of assault . the confirmed harm done arguably outweighs the potential harm of making it easier for some predators to hurt people in scenarios that are frankly not very applicable to singapore . there are already many other things we could do to greatly reduce that harm if we wanted like not letting rapists off easy because they have good grades , and prohibiting marital rape which we took so long to do . so it s always suspect when people call to deny rights to trans people on the basis of concern about potential sexual assault , when actual sexual assault is not treated with the same level of panic and call to action . lastly much like how repealing 377a doesn t mean churches will be banned from saying that being gay is bad , giving trans people access to legal gender recognition to reduce harassment and enable access to jobs , marriage and housing doesn t mean trans people freely parading around nude spas with genitals on display . there are many , many steps between here to there , and one that doesn t mesh with our culture , and the size of our population , the way it does with canada .

the law is a fine middle stance against homosexuality that still provides leeway for homosexuals .,"why is it wrong ? people who are making efforts to prevent homosexual relations are doing so with or without the law . also , the law doesn t govern private relations , it s absolutely ok for a man to find a boyfriend . the law is a fine middle stance against homosexuality that still provides leeway for homosexuals . would you rather it be absolute ? with a largely conservative stance on the issue , it would be much easier to strengthen laws against homosexuals then it is to repeal the law .

what some people are afraid of is the supposed moral and birthrate decline that s going to happen if 377a disappears .,"most people would see the repeal of 377a as the first step to allow gay couples to marry have civil unions . from that , they could potentially be allowed to be legally recognized as nok , apply for hdb before 35 years old , adopt surrogate children , amongst other things . these are some privileges of life that others take for granted . some would mention that gays pay taxes too , and should get whatever the straights can . what some people are afraid of is the supposed moral and birthrate decline that s going to happen if 377a disappears . personally , i don t see how that should even be a point . more realistic fears are that religious bodies private companies are expected to endorse condone future marriages religious bakers got into trouble by rejecting to bake a cake for gays in the us . i don t expect this to happen here , seeing that organizations businesses rightfully should have the right to refuse clients . other fears include all toilets magically being converted to allow any genders to use and therefore more prone to sexual assault , and the use of hormone puberty blockers on children i m a little impartial on this . as for your mention of stds , the only way of curbing it is through sex ed . people need to know how to protect themselves during intercourse . that can come with or without 377a being repealed , although i d argue it s easier if it is repealed . as of now , schools in singapore do provide some sex ed teaching the use of condoms , at least , but as far as i recall , teachers are made to keep the topic of homosexuality hush hush or in a negative light , which may not help a young horny gay boy with questions . if the stigma s removed sooner , more thorough and open formal education would come easier . to add on to my point above , in the us , states that are more religious and taught only abstinence in schools have higher teen pregnancy rates . by inference , abstinence only sex ed does less to prevent unprotected sex as compared to a more comprehensive sex ed programme . if a law is supposedly there to prevent the spread of stds , should it not be the case that it criminalizes anyone with stds who have sex ? 377a does little to nothing to prevent the spread of stds , gay or otherwise . either way , if criminalizing an entire population for a subset of its group is singapore s way of handling things , it s just sad .

"cause in their perspective , the push to accept lgbtq rights is an external party coming in , telling them what they should or shouldn t accept .","you re framing it in your perspective , and that s exactly my point . their perspective on the same event is different . cause in their perspective , the push to accept lgbtq rights is an external party coming in , telling them what they should or shouldn t accept . . they do not ask that fundamentalist christian s have gay sex or even accept gay people and no , they are exactly doing that . we are asking them to accept gay people , at least in their perspectives . and even christianity has shown itself capable of change there s plenty of lgbtq affirming churches popping up all the time . females didn t used to be able to be ordained , but now some denominations do . so i just don t subscribe to the just fuck the homophobes there s no getting through to all of them attitude most people adopt here . most people who are phobic of something just have very little understanding of not interacted much with the thing they fear . guess what can potentially solve that ? ostracization or education exposure ?
