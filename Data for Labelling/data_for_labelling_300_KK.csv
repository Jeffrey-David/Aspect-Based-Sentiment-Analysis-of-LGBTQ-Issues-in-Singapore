"it s not realistic to consider that letting trans people change our gender markers without genital surgery is going to result in this happening , not least because singapore doesn t have that same kind of comfort around nudity .",trans,1,25-07-2022 13:33,Reddit," firstly the spa case is an outlier where the person was trying to make some kind of statement and bait others into outrage . it s not realistic to consider that letting trans people change our gender markers without genital surgery is going to result in this happening , not least because singapore doesn t have that same kind of comfort around nudity . i ve been in both male and female public facilities toilets , locker rooms , showers and have never seen another naked person in my life , other when accidentally walking in on my family while they re changing clothes . with that caveat , to answer your question yes , it makes it easier . in the same way that allowing male teachers makes it more likely for students to be sexually abused allowing teenagers to date without a chaperone makes it easier for them to be raped allowing cars mean that 1 . 3 million people die in traffic accidents every year allowing social gatherings makes it easier for covid to spread and kill people . society is full of those balances where we have agreed to take the risk . it s about how much we value the freedoms , dignity and quality of life that would be lost should we aim for perfect safety . and in this case , maintaining the status quo means denying a vulnerable minority of human dignity and framing us all as potential sex offenders reducible to our genitals , when trans people are significantly more likely to ourselves be victims of assault . the confirmed harm done arguably outweighs the potential harm of making it easier for some predators to hurt people in scenarios that are frankly not very applicable to singapore . there are already many other things we could do to greatly reduce that harm if we wanted like not letting rapists off easy because they have good grades , and prohibiting marital rape which we took so long to do . so it s always suspect when people call to deny rights to trans people on the basis of concern about potential sexual assault , when actual sexual assault is not treated with the same level of panic and call to action . lastly much like how repealing 377a doesn t mean churches will be banned from saying that being gay is bad , giving trans people access to legal gender recognition to reduce harassment and enable access to jobs , marriage and housing doesn t mean trans people freely parading around nude spas with genitals on display . there are many , many steps between here to there , and one that doesn t mesh with our culture , and the size of our population , the way it does with canada .

is love what motivated a certain group to petition hpb to remove their fact based faq on human sexuality because it said homosexuality is normal ?,homosexuality,1,25-07-2022 07:46,Reddit," does someone opposed to repealing 377 have to be touting lies and hatred ? like it or not , we all subscribe to dogma i m sorry , but what bullshit . do you know that lgbt individuals face greater risk of suicide , depression and anxiety because of the discrimination they experience ? do you know how more strain and effort is actually required to stay in the closet ? seriously , having to maintain a facade and erase parts of my identity is exhausting . do you know how stressful it is to live with the fear that one might be disowned by their parents ? how is it not hateful for parents to disown their children for something they cannot change ? how is it not hateful to exploit the vulnerable and push them towards de facto conversion programs , that do not work and are likely to cause psychological harm , like truelove . is ? conversely , there are plenty of supportive parents with lgbt children in singapore . why don t you ask those parents how loved they feel when they see their children get treated so poorly ? i guess some families just matter less . do you know the tinge of hurt one constantly feels when they see others experiencing basic joys in life i . e . sharing a loved one with the family that one knows they ll likely never be able to experience ? do you know how tiring it is to be attacked and denigrated just for being who you are and when you haven t done anything to justify that hate ? is campaigning for nlb to remove a children s book born out of love ? is love what motivated a certain group to petition hpb to remove their fact based faq on human sexuality because it said homosexuality is normal ? is that what drove that same group to attempt a takeover of aware ? what next , you re going to tell me the wear white movement , that explicitly denigrates lgbt individuals , isn t hateful ? all the vitriol over a 1 second kiss scene in a movie like lightyear is what exactly ? sorry , but dogma doesn t excuse any of that . it certainly doesn t change the fact that it s ultimately based on hate . hate the sin , not the sinner rings hollow when those beliefs actively make my life more difficult and miserable . meanwhile , my request to just be treated equally has zero impact on the religious . gtfo with this false equivalence . and believe our view is the right one . would you like to explain how discrimination is ever the right view ?

treated as one felt fundamentally wrong and i didn t know why . but even by that age i was aware that it was not something it was ok to say christian family , even though i cried about it a lot and my parents didn t know what was wrong . for the most part i could ignore it though , until puberty , when that sense of wrongness went into overdrive and just kept getting worse and worse until i finally

political reasons . for others who don t experience that distress , they might benefit from waiting until they re older and more sure . they may also realise that they re trans but don t feel dysphoric over their bodies . and if medical professionals are preaching caution and advocating for age 18 , i m inclined to believe them . for hrt , the advised age is 16 . 18 or 21 for any sex reassignment surgery depending on country and procedure . puberty blockers are used for those under 16 who are assessed to be suitable for treatment , or where the youth wants more time to be sure before committing to either male or female puberty . in cases of severe gender dysphoria , and or where regret is unlikely such as if they ve been living happily as that gender since childhood like jazz jennings , hrt may begin at younger ages on a case by case basis . from reading doctor s responses from other articles it always gives me the impression they re preaching caution , but are careful not to commit to a full no , or they are unwilling to talk about this issue unfiltered . possibly the latter for some , but the cautious approach is the official stance from medical authorities like the apa . they advise a step by step approach and not pressuring the child into one identity or another , as well as acting on a harm reduction basis . i . e . if a child is constantly crying and extremely distressed about not being allowed to do feminine things , then let them do feminine things and see if that helps . it doesn t mean they re a trans girl . but neither should the parents insist that they act like a boy and force them to do masculine activities . likewise if the kid prefers wearing dresses , or having long hair , or being called by a female name . maybe it s a phase they ll eventually grow out of , or he s just a feminine guy , or maybe she ll turn out to be a trans girl when puberty comes around . it doesn t mean letting them do anything they want , but rather not unnecessarily forcing gender norms on a kid when that s clearly causing them psychological harm , and remaining open to the possibilities that the kid might or might not be trans . let s just say assuming we discover transgenderism is a biological phenomenon in the future there s actually robust scientific support for that , much more than sexual orientation . at this point we re sure that biology definitely plays some part , and it s just a question of how much . we still need to acknowledge the power of the environment , which is what many liberal , virtue signaling parents are doing to their children right now . perhaps , but definitely not in singapore . i generally don t like using the west as an example for social things because our cultures and laws are very different . for example , singaporeans are much more obedient and don t dare to cause trouble by suing people or starting protests , even when we re upset , and the same applies to those of us who are trans . even overseas , i do think that stereotype is not truly reflective of reality .

"across the world , scores of countries still require transgender people to submit to such surgeries before their genders are legally recognized , a practice international human rights bodies have condemned as torture .",rights,1,12-11-2022,Hardware Zone,"she was the only woman soldier working in the guard room , surrounded by men who harassed and frightened her after she said she was transgender . she tried to ignore them as they opened up their shirts and pretended to rape each other , while beckoning her to join them . and then one day , as lune loh stood under the searing singaporean sun , one of those men took his rifle and tried to shove it between her legs . she was a woman . she was not supposed to be here , because singapore s compulsory , two year military service is required only for 18 year old men . but under singapore law , she was still considered a man , because she had not undergone surgery that would render her sterile . across the world , scores of countries still require transgender people to submit to such surgeries before their genders are legally recognized , a practice international human rights bodies have condemned as torture . these policies have left untold numbers of transgender people with an agonizing choice between their fertility and their identity . for those who opt against surgery , the policies consequences can be severe , limiting their prospects for jobs , housing , marriage and safe passage through the world . since their identification documents list their genders as the opposite of how they present in public , they can easily be outed , leading to everything from bureaucratic hassles to life threatening confrontations . for some , the fear of being outed is so intense that they withdraw from the world . loh , however , has taken the opposite approach , becoming an unusually visible transgender rights activist in singapore , a rigidly controlled city state that only announced it would decriminalize sex between men in august . now 25 , loh is still healing from the wounds of her military past . and she finds herself grappling with questions about her future , like whether any company will ever employ her , or whether she will ever be able to have a biological child . and so , though speaking out carries risk , silence for loh is not an option . people are not getting housing , people are not getting jobs . . . that s basically what we re fighting for , she says . we just want to help people survive another day , another month , another year . at the heart of the debate over gender recognition laws is the importance of identity . the legal documents that define our identity are crucial to navigating life and the world , from getting a bank loan to crossing a border . in much of the world , changing gender markers on identification documents remains impossible . other countries allow such changes , but often with draconian prerequisites including sterilization , psychiatric interventions , and for any married person mandatory divorce . there s a lot of requirements in most of these laws imposed on trans people which are all violating the basic human rights the right to privacy , the right to bodily integrity , the right to non discrimination , the right to identity , says julia ehrt , executive director of the international lesbian , gay , bisexual , trans and intersex association , or ilga world . surgery makes some transgender people feel more comfortable in their bodies , but others consider it medically unnecessary , invasive and painful or prohibitively expensive . some people simply cannot have it for medical reasons . gender confirmation surgery can involve a variety of procedures that alter a person s sexual characteristics , some of which lead to permanent sterility . while the law in some countries explicitly spells out that sterilization must be an outcome for legal gender recognition , in most cases the ultimate intentions behind these policies are unclear and likely varied . but whether rendering transgender people sterile is the goal of these mandates , it s generally the result . in the u . s . , 13 states and territories have a surgical requirement to update gender markers on birth certificates , and four require it for updating driver s licenses , according to olivia hunt , policy director for the national center for transgender equality . the states do not clarify what procedures they will accept . even after surgery , the process of obtaining a legal gender change can be convoluted and humiliating . in australia , two states require two separate examinations of post surgery genitalia by doctors , who must sign statutory declarations confirming a surgical procedure involving the alteration of a person s reproductive organs . any false statement by the doctor , the new south wales state form warns , could result in two years imprisonment . we don t even force sex offenders to be sterilized in this country , but you re forcing transgender people just to get a birth certificate ? come on , says kirsti miller , a new south wales woman who underwent gender confirmation surgery in 2006 , and was forced to divorce her childhood sweetheart . new south wales removed the divorce mandate in 2018 . in singapore , the surgery requirement has affected even children , says coen teo , executive director of transbefrienders , a non profit supporting transgender youth . singaporeans under 21 must get parental consent to undergo gender confirmation surgery , a landmine for transgender children reluctant to tell their conservative families about their transition . but if they don t , they are required at many schools to use bathrooms and wear uniforms that match the gender marker on their national identity card , causing anguish . they don t feel themselves in school , so they can t concentrate in school , so a lot of them don t do well . and i m speaking from experience , says teo , a transgender man . most gender confirmation procedures are not offered in singapore , forcing several teens at transbefrienders to travel overseas and spend possibly tens of thousands of dollars . they want to get back in school , they want to get back their life , teo says . it s a huge hurdle for them . in a statement to the associated press , the ministry of home affairs said the information on singaporeans national identity cards reflects a person s sex , which the government determines based on the person s biological and physical attributes . to change that marker requires proof of surgery , and the complete alteration of one s physical reproductive attributes , the ministry said . this allows the government to implement policies and laws based on sex in a consistent manner , the ministry said . human rights watchdogs have spent years demanding an end to policies like these . in a 2013 report , the united nations special rapporteur on torture urged governments to outlaw forced or coerced sterilization in all circumstances . the following year , seven u . n . agencies , including the world health organization , said gender recognition policies requiring sterilization run counter to respect for bodily integrity , self determination and human dignity . many countries have been slow to respond . in 2019 , japan s supreme court upheld as constitutional the country s gender recognition law that requires surgical sterilization . some governments , however , have made changes . in 2012 , argentina became the first country to grant legal gender recognition based entirely on self determination . in 2018 , sweden became the first country to financially compensate transgender people who were sterilized under its old policy . germany is considering similar compensation . around 10 , 000 transgender germans were sterilized under the country s former policy , according to advocacy group bundesverband trans asterisk . cathrin ramelow , a 58 year old german transgender woman , is fighting for compensation and an apology from the government . in 2000 , she underwent surgical sterilization , welcoming the chance to end her double life . but afterwards , she says , she agonized over what she had lost . you know there s something wrong with you and you can t have children anymore , she says . i cried some days . years later , loh would make the opposite choice . but she found that it , too , came with a steep cost . tucked against the wall of a spare room in loh s apartment is the camouflage backpack she carried during her two years of enforced military service . one recent afternoon , she plunges a slender arm inside it and pulls out her old helmet , staring at it briefly before shoving it away . they are artifacts of a time she likens to torture . she remains vanishingly thin from the eating disorder she developed during her service , an attempt to counter the masculinization of her body from the intense physical drills . loh is a poet with a wide grin , brainy and sensitive , eager to chat about philosophy , politics , art and music . but when she talks about her army days , her easy laugh turns nervous and her face goes dark . she was raised as a boy by a protective mother and a conservative , stern father she grew to fear . though he socialized loh to be masculine , she knew early on that her body did not match who she was . her first realization or flash point that something was off came one night at age 8 , when she caught her distorted reflection in a window and suddenly imagined herself with long hair . more flashpoints would follow until at 17 , she read an article about transgender people coming out late in life . that was , she says , the moment her egg cracked how much longer will you wait , she asked herself , before you live the life you want ? she would wait one more year , until after her father had left the family . her mother , stella wong , would embrace buddhism , and ultimately loh s identity . everything is impermanent , whether you are male or female , says wong , whose normally cheerful manner morphs into rage when strangers stare at her daughter . in buddhism , gender is nothing .

psychologist dr david canter said no one should be assigned the label transgender before puberty . if the child is unhappy then the reasons should be explored without assigning labels . i fully agree with this . though this is also before puberty . once puberty hits , for many trans people the wrong body feeling either begins or starts greatly intensifying and is very unlikely to reverse . i d say never , but there may be exceptions . those are usually the ones who start seeking medical intervention and are very unlikely to regret it . the few such regret cases i know of changed their minds for religious political reasons . for others who don t experience that distress , they might benefit from waiting until they re older and more sure . they may also realise that they re trans but don t feel dysphoric over their bodies . and if medical professionals are preaching caution and advocating for age 18 , i m inclined to believe them . for hrt , the advised age is 16 . 18 or 21 for any sex reassignment surgery depending on country and procedure . puberty blockers are used for those under 16 who are assessed to be suitable for treatment , or where the youth wants more time to be sure before committing to either male or female puberty . in cases of severe gender dysphoria , and or where regret is unlikely such as if they ve been living happily as that gender since childhood like jazz jennings , hrt may begin at younger ages on a case by case basis . from reading doctor s responses from other articles it always gives me the impression they re preaching caution , but are careful not to commit to a full no , or they are unwilling to talk about this issue unfiltered . possibly the latter for some , but the cautious approach is the official stance from medical authorities like the apa . they advise a step by step approach and not pressuring the child into one identity or another , as well as acting on a harm reduction basis . i . e . if a child is constantly crying and extremely distressed about not being allowed to do feminine things , then let them do feminine things and see if that helps . it doesn t mean they re a trans girl . but neither should the parents insist that they act like a boy and force them to do masculine activities . likewise if the kid prefers wearing dresses , or having long hair , or being called by a female name . maybe it s a phase they ll eventually grow out of , or he s just a feminine guy , or maybe she ll turn out to be a trans girl when puberty comes around . it doesn t mean letting them do anything they want , but rather not unnecessarily forcing gender norms on a kid when that s clearly causing them psychological harm , and remaining open to the possibilities that the kid might or might not be trans . let s just say assuming we discover transgenderism is a biological phenomenon in the future there s actually robust scientific support for that , much more than sexual orientation . at this point we re sure that biology definitely plays some part , and it s just a question of how much . we still need to acknowledge the power of the environment , which is what many liberal , virtue signaling parents are doing to their children right now . perhaps , but definitely not in singapore . i generally don t like using the west as an example for social things because our cultures and laws are very different . for example , singaporeans are much more obedient and don t dare to cause trouble by suing people or starting protests , even when we re upset , and the same applies to those of us who are trans . even overseas , i do think that stereotype is not truly reflective of reality .

"in the case of a trans youth with a strong gender identity who is clearly gender dysphoric upon the onset of puberty , where their situation worsens as puberty progresses , they are virtually guaranteed to remain trans into adulthood .",gender identity,1,08-03-2021 08:38,Reddit,"puberty blockers and cross sex hrt are not the same . the former is reversible , the latter is not . i agree about irreversible choices , but that s the thing not doing anything is itself an irreversible choice . in the case of a trans youth with a strong gender identity who is clearly gender dysphoric upon the onset of puberty , where their situation worsens as puberty progresses , they are virtually guaranteed to remain trans into adulthood . refusing to allow them access to puberty blockers will be doing irreversible harm . in their case , waiting will do little good at the very best they may grow up to be a trans or gender non conforming person who has made peace with their body , but there s the risk they may not , and instead experience lasting trauma from the experience of having their bodies irreversibly change towards a sex that is wrong for them . whereas even those who would have otherwise been ok with their bodies would be likely to be just as ok , if not more so , if they had been able to transition young . as a note while prepubescent children with gender dysphoria symptoms sometimes outgrow this and may simply be gender non conforming and or lgb , dysphoria that persists after puberty begins is typically permanent . despite the name , puberty blockers are administered only after puberty has reached a certain stage , rather than before , because how the child responds to the onset of puberty can itself help clarify their gender identity and desire for medical intervention .

"in conclusion , homosexuality still plays a part in the modern state , whether by conferring kinship or sexual reproductive benefits .",homosexuality,1,23-05-2018 23:07,Reddit,"it is highly unlikely for homosexuals to be selected against in an evolutionary sense . we have to take into account the fact that the modern state is a very recent concept , and that kinship ties and sexual selection still play important roles in sexual reproduction under the modern state . evolution occurs over a very very long span of time . if you take a pre historic human thousands and thousands of years ago and compare him her to a modern human , both of them would be biologically indistinguishable . the whole of human history is but a blip in the evolutionary timeline . the concept of a modern state , is as the name suggests , modern and thus would have had a negligible effect on human evolution so far . only if the structure of a modern state persists for tens of thousands of years can we perhaps start seeing an evolutionary change in human populations whereby anti social traits are able to persist since they are not as heavily selected against as they would before . even then , social traits like homosexuality would not be heavily selected against as kinship ties are still highly important in the modern state . we still organize ourselves into extended family groups and occasionally look to relatives for support when things get tough . in addition , as i pointed out in my earlier post , homosexuality may also confer benefits to heterosexual reproduction . if a particular trait has a strong effect on making women more sexually attractive , while a weak effect in making men homosexual , selection pressures will then allow these homosexual traits to persist in populations as they benefit heterosexual reproduction with only a minor evolutionary drawback in the rare homosexual cases . of course , vice versa can happen . read the bbc article linked in my previous post . ultimately , this means that as long as sexual reproduction in humans occurs , homosexuality can still persist as it benefits the overall population . and i think we can agree on the fact that sexual reproduction is definitely still around in the era of the modern state . in conclusion , homosexuality still plays a part in the modern state , whether by conferring kinship or sexual reproductive benefits . this , of course , presupposes the fact that the modern state will continue to be structurally present for tens of thousands of years such that it has an impact on evolution which is not highly likely . the only way for homosexuality to be considered evolutionary non advantageous would be in a dystopian modern state where the government decides who you have sex and raise a child with no sexual attractiveness factor in reproduction and each nuclear family is governmentally forbidden from ever knowing or interacting with their extended family no kinship factor . and this government must persist for many many millennia . i think one option is likelier than the other .

"thus , this could explain some homosexual behaviour observed in primates , dolphins , etc .",homosexual,0,23-05-2018 15:23,Reddit,"i m glad to continue this reasoned and thought provoking discussion . based on my understanding of this phenomenon , which scientists have dubbed as kin selection i . e . evolutionary natural selection applied through family members and relatives , this would apply mainly to animals that are predominantly social in nature . thus , this could explain some homosexual behaviour observed in primates , dolphins , etc . even some social species where homosexual behavior is not observed , such as in ants , these species have a similar process where members are sterile . e . g . only the queen of the ant hive reproduces , and every other ant simply ensures the queen can produce the best offspring . kin selection can manifest itself through different means depending on species . homosexual behavior displayed in non social species can also be explained through the concept that homosexual traits can persist in populations because they confer evolutionary advantages to the opposite sex . the bbc has a very excellent article on this http www . bbc . com news magazine 26089486 , but an example is that some feminine traits may highly boost the attractiveness of women . thus , these genes persist in the population . when a male has a small combination of these traits , it may not affect his sexual inclination . but on the rare occasion a male has a larger combination of these traits , he may then be homosexual . so while on the individual scale these traits may be reproductively detrimental , on a larger population scale they make the women more attractive thus boosting the evolutionary fitness of the population with a minor trade off . hence , these traits continue to persist . vice versa can also occur . of course this is a simplification and there is no one single gay gene . but the general idea helps to explain and also show how evolution is applied to an individual vs population scale . this concept can then explain homosexual behavior found in less social species . given that humans are both social and also individually reproductive , these two processes could work in tandem to ensure the evolutionary fitness of homosexual behavior , and likewise for other species too .

yet people are still homosexual despite the huge increase in difficulty in living .,homosexual,1,25-07-2022 09:58,Reddit," yes , and you ve chose to play with words . instead of answering the question straight . is sexual identity nature or nurtured ? you mentioned that paedophiles are both natural nurtured . can you cite any research ? now you re putting words into my mouth ? i have not said such at all . during my age of discovery , i basically used wanking to measure my sexual preference . which i suspect many do as well , with pornography . that s a beautiful tree . let s try wanking to it . hmm , not successful . hence i discovered the difference between sexual aesthetic beauty . i am pretty sure that not many others do the same but if it works for you , you do you . but have you actually tried having sex with people of the same sex ? because the idea of something when masturbating is very different from the actual feeling you get when doing it . if i were to be able to achieve sexual gratification with both males females . but a higher degree of satisfaction with my same sex . then it can be a personal choice . except homosexuals do not get any sexual gratification with people of the opposite sex . and the government has admitted that this law is not right and the only reason they keep it is to placate certain groups that have no reason to be sticking their nose in who other people have sex with . for example , i need to get high . but i m allergic to alcohol . why are there laws specifically targeting my ability to get high then ? so it s drink alcohol , provoke an allergic reaction . or choose to break the law , risking a jail term if you are talking about drugs , drugs like weed that does not have harm are not illegal in other countries . it is something that other countries are discussing within themselves . a risk that our law minister chief justice has publicly stated , that practitioners of homosexual sex will not be subjected to . so why even make a fuss about a law that is not enforced ? because the law has many cascading effects . it emboldens people to sprout anti lgbtq hate because lgbtq people are criminals . it prevents same sex unions , which means no bto , not being allowed to visit your partner when they are hospitalized , not inheriting their cpf in case of death due to being considered a legal stranger to them , not being able to make medical decisions for your partner even in emergencies , having no protection against discriminatory hiring firing , having no protections against schools forcing you to leave just because you are lgbtq , and so on . ok , since established conversion therapy is harmful . let s try to improve it , so that it s not harmful . and it had been tried for a long time . science has proven that it is harmful and unethical to keep trying . so why do you insist on perpetuating torture to forcefully convert someone s sexuality when it has zero impact on your life ? why not nurture a people with straight sexual orientations then ? and why do you think we have so many barriers in singapore that makes living as an lgbtq person so painful and uncomfortable ? do you not see that our society promotes being straight so much while penalizing people who are homosexual ? yet people are still homosexual despite the huge increase in difficulty in living . do you think we just want to live life on hard mode ? and ultimately , allowing lgbtq people to be themselves have zero impact on people like you . so why are you so insistent on us facing discrimination and even encouraging putting us through torture just to pacify people like you ? if you say it saves the policy maker all this grief , that better way is to give equal rights immediately and make the bigotry illegal . which is what happened to stop our racial tensions in the past .

legalized homosexuality was the doorway to legalized bestiality and pedophilia we begin by legalizing homosexuality .,homosexuality,-1,03-05-2019 19:50,Reddit," . . . legalized homosexuality was the doorway to legalized bestiality and pedophilia we begin by legalizing homosexuality . in doing so we reject the basis on which the law was created likely due to christian doctrine , traces back to our british colonial history . christian doctrine ceases to be a legitimate basis in the upholding of certain other laws actually on most counts , it probably already has . in the absence of other backing arguments , these laws are in fact open to debate . new reasoning is required if we are to uphold these other laws . they could be from concepts of morality from other religions or based in science , but the point is that new consensus has to be reached , and with it comes a discussion not unlike the one we re having right now . what really is the basis on which we uphold our laws ? x200b hypothetically this new consensus could be formed upon a moral framework not unlike the one you suggested , which seeks to uphold human rights as long as they don t infringe on others . a minority group of people who practice bestiality can then make the argument that they don t infringe on anyone s freedom . following which , our initial rejection of the christian doctrine and legalizing of homosexuality has led to the legalizing of bestiality . pedophilia probably doesn t work out under this framework , but a different consensus albeit a more absurd one could lead to its legalization as well . x200b i don t mean to imply that homosexuals and people who practice bestiality are the same class of people , and this hypothetical scenario is really just that hypothetical but where legalization is concerned , op s argument that legalizing homosexuality can eventually lead to legalized bestiality , is not entirely without merit . x200b that said , the reason why most people wouldn t think this hypothetical scenario is likely is probably because there is already a general consensus that exists which separates the homosexuals from these other classes of people . we just need to spell it out formally rather than casting it as common sense , because only then can we safely remove the christian doctrine and hence , laws against homosexuality completely from the law without exposing it to arguments that seek to repeal other laws currently upheld by that doctrine . this is the framework i seek .

"even some social species where homosexual behavior is not observed , such as in ants , these species have a similar process where members are sterile .",homosexual,0,23-05-2018 15:23,Reddit,"i m glad to continue this reasoned and thought provoking discussion . based on my understanding of this phenomenon , which scientists have dubbed as kin selection i . e . evolutionary natural selection applied through family members and relatives , this would apply mainly to animals that are predominantly social in nature . thus , this could explain some homosexual behaviour observed in primates , dolphins , etc . even some social species where homosexual behavior is not observed , such as in ants , these species have a similar process where members are sterile . e . g . only the queen of the ant hive reproduces , and every other ant simply ensures the queen can produce the best offspring . kin selection can manifest itself through different means depending on species . homosexual behavior displayed in non social species can also be explained through the concept that homosexual traits can persist in populations because they confer evolutionary advantages to the opposite sex . the bbc has a very excellent article on this http www . bbc . com news magazine 26089486 , but an example is that some feminine traits may highly boost the attractiveness of women . thus , these genes persist in the population . when a male has a small combination of these traits , it may not affect his sexual inclination . but on the rare occasion a male has a larger combination of these traits , he may then be homosexual . so while on the individual scale these traits may be reproductively detrimental , on a larger population scale they make the women more attractive thus boosting the evolutionary fitness of the population with a minor trade off . hence , these traits continue to persist . vice versa can also occur . of course this is a simplification and there is no one single gay gene . but the general idea helps to explain and also show how evolution is applied to an individual vs population scale . this concept can then explain homosexual behavior found in less social species . given that humans are both social and also individually reproductive , these two processes could work in tandem to ensure the evolutionary fitness of homosexual behavior , and likewise for other species too .

80 of singaporeans live in state subsidized public housing that serves as their primary asset . access to new flats is largely set aside for young , married couples , with grants of as much as s 80 , 000 57 , 000 . lgbtq applicants categorized as single buyers can only enter the market when they turn 35 , with a limited pool of smaller apartments to choose from and lower government subsidies . at a time when my peers were settling down and building homes , it was very clear that was out of reach for me , said adrianna tan , a 36 year old singaporean professional now living in san francisco with her wife . there s the assumption that queer singaporeans will simply rent or buy private property , because there s the perception that we are rich . in a speech on sunday , prime minister lee hsien loong said the government would repeal section 377a of the penal code that criminalizes sex between men , but would also amend the constitution to protect the legal definition of marriage a union between a man and a woman from being challenged in the courts . the move was seen as a compromise between lgbtq rights advocates and more conservative members of singaporean society , but it frustrated people who had hoped to see the government go further since section 377a has gone unenforced for years . with rental and private property prices climbing to records , the move to change the constitution could make it even harder for lgbtq citizens to get equal access to more affordable homes built by the housing and development board . singapore says to abolish law criminalizing sex between men lee said many national policies rely upon singapore s legal definition of marriage , including public housing , education , adoption rules , advertising standards and film classification . the government has no intention of changing the definition of marriage or the policies based on it , he said on sunday . even though the government repealed section 377a , it still upholds family centric policies , said tien foo sing , a real estate professor at the national university of singapore . singapore is one of asia s most expensive property markets , making the availability of state subsidized homes the only way to enter the market for most citizens . under its build to order program , the hdb assesses applications for ballots of newly constructed properties to citizens , giving first time married applicants with children preferential treatment . the median waiting time for a flat is between four and five years . around 31 of singapore s population above the age of 15 were classified as single in 2021 , government data show . there are no official numbers on the lgbtq community in the city state . with the government offering parenthood incentives to address the nation s falling birth rate and housing stock closely aligned with population planning , it s unlikely to relax restrictions for single buyers . almost all new hdb flats are on a 99 year lease and buyers are forbidden from reselling for five years . larger hdb units in the best neighborhoods can resell for more than s 1 million . by contrast , private two bedroom condos in the central part of the city go for around s 2 . 5 million , according to listings on property portal 99 . co . singapore residents earn a median gross monthly income of s 4 , 680 , according to data from the ministry of manpower . the option of private housing is a luxury for most , said william tan , a realtor who specializes in serving lgbtq clients . only those with at least a s 6 , 000 monthly income can even consider buying a condo and not many people under 35 are there yet . singaporean andee chua , 32 , purchased a one bedroom private condo when he was 29 after several years of renting with his partner . the down payment was difficult . i used up almost all my savings and my parents had to step in to help . the cost of his apartment was comparable to the five room hdb resale unit that his sister , a mother of two , had bought . chua is considering selling his condo to purchase a larger hdb flat when he turns 35 . tan said few lgbtq couples bid for bto flats , given the small size of the units they can get and the long wait time . you will be 40 when you get your home and 45 if you want to sell it after the minimum occupancy period , tan said . profits from the sale will not be enough to upgrade to something more substantial . married couples with a head start can typically resell their larger , more valuable hdb flats for a decent profit in their thirties , he said . it s still hard for us to own a home , and getting harder , said adrianna tan , the san francisco resident who relocated to the us in 2018 . our housing market is hot , and the barriers to entry are high simply because we are not heterosexual or married .

i have not seen a keep 377a argument that is not derived from a basis of morality that is not religious in nature .,377a,0,30-09-2018 00:59,Reddit,"1 . it doesnt matter what religion they are , but it matter what their arguments are based on . i have not seen a keep 377a argument that is not derived from a basis of morality that is not religious in nature . this is different from arguments from the repeal side whose arguments from justice and fairness are not derived from religious scripture but from legal or philosophical scholarship . 2 . i would bite the bullet here to say that consensual polygamy and incest should also be legal . in fact , places like germany which is very pro christian have already legalised incest relationships while still banning them from having children . my point is that its not analogous to homosexuality because in both incest and polygamy , power and social dynamics within the relationships are much more salient such that it is unlikely that it is fully consensual . hence , more regulation of those kind of relationships should be allowed , even if we do decriminalise it . 3 . it is not an acceptable compromise at all . separation of powers is key to our state s stability . the ag s responsibility to prosecute all given laws is bedrock to that . can you imagine what would happen if a very religious ag was appointed ? or if pap is no longer in power ? right now its okay because its an unwritten rule that ag doesnt prosecute . but there is no legal strength in such a way of doing things . without proper laws and protection , i m not confident that such an arrangement can last . christians in singapore have already tried to subvert the secular govt a number of times . remember aware ? imagine if thio li ann or her mother were appointed as ag .

"you see that in the law , the fundamental rights afforded to hetero sex couples isn t for the benefit of the couple itself what use is a marriage union for society such that it need rights and protections ?",rights,0,24-07-2022 13:52,Reddit,"ah . therein lies the issue . you see that in the law , the fundamental rights afforded to hetero sex couples isn t for the benefit of the couple itself what use is a marriage union for society such that it need rights and protections ? . the couple itself alone cannot be a building block of society , because society has no need for unions that achieve nothing . the primary concern of a society is its current health and it s future health the ability of that society to continue itself . the rights historically afforded to hetero sex unions is not actually to protect the union itself but to protect and flourish the eventual creation of a next generation that would naturally occur from that union . the future of that society obviously a few things have changed culturally . for example , the widespread availability of contraception and the ability of hetero sex unions to control the creation of offspring though methods such as abortion . so that brings us back to the same question we began with . but phrased within the context that the hetero sex unions are no longer a guarantee for the creation of offspring as opposed to maybe 100 200 years ago . are these rights 1 . still applicable to hetero sex unions . 2 . should be extended to same sex unions . once you view the problem with this in mind , the solutions aren t so clear cut anymore .

"from these two facts , i ll give it to you that they are anti lgbt with regards only to 377a .",377a,0,04-03-2020 22:42,Reddit," first , please , refrain from putting words in my mouth . i only agree that protestants are worse . i don t acknowledge that one group is way worse feel free to quote me . it is very tiring to have to make these corrections , while at the same time being accused by your of lies and misinformation . ok so why call out catholics and angelicans a denomination of protestants who are relatively more passive than groups that organize anti lgbt campaigns as the main anti lgbt group and completely disregard the the groups who are actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? second , i use the term protestants generally simply because you have been using anglicans and catholics . it is long and tiring to have to say the other christians who are not anglicans or catholics , so i have used protestants . if you prefer another label that is convenient , i have no problems using that . thank you for confirming and proving my point . you have deep seated psychological issue that causes you to casually stereotype vastly different groups . here is what you said earlier you seem to be saying that hang on , the protestants are way worse ! they have their wear white campaign , and pray that it will rain on pink dot . you would rather further generalize and stereotype with protestant a 10 letter word , than use the acronyms of the groups that both organize wear white movement and have conversion therapy , both of which contain only 4 characters . essentially you are now saying angelicans , methodists , presbyterians , all of the seven local denominations actively participate in the wear white campaign . and your reasoning is because it is long and tiring . it literally takes less effort to actually not stereotype and name the actual groups . if that s not a prime example of stererotyping , i don t know what is . your psychological issue of casual stereotyping is propagating misinformation and falsehoods , and you need to stop . if you can t , i suggest you seek help , because people like you stir up dissent amongst peaceful relationships . by the way , the notion that not all protestants participate in or even support the wear white campaign , or conversion therapy . can simply be reversed to point out that not all catholics are opposed to wear white or conversion therapy . clearly , you will see variance in the nature of belief in any faith , so any discussion will necessarily have to encompass some degree of generalities . i m sure you recognize a fundamental difference between a group that teaches love and accept lgbt people and a group that teaches homosexuality is a mental illness . you even said it yourself that one is worse . so why are you still sterotyping both groups as one , while naming only the groups that are relatively more supportive and passive by not actually actively organizing anti lgbt movements , while refusing to admit you re willfully being obtuse by choosing to disregard the groups that are organizing anti lgbt campaigns ? i ve already explained that i still regard the differences as fairly minor , in the grand scheme of things . therefore you are admitting that you are sterotyping , and your intention is therefore to stir shit because you know and admit one group is worse than the other but you still support calling the group that is relatively more supportive and passive out and ignoring the group that is actively campaigning against lgbt . i know you re going to deny it , you can keep telling yourself that , but i really don t know how you sleep at night knowing that because you re too afraid to shatter your fragile ego , you refuse to admit that you would rather call the group that teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people out as the largest anti lgbt group while you completely disregard the actual group that organizes anti lgbt campaigns . to me , you are willfully spreading lies and misinformation that all churches have the same stand regarding lgbt , an issue that my lgbt friends and family have shown to be something they care about as it matters to them what their friends and family actually believe . it also matters to them that for all the acceptance of them , the catholic church still does not consider them able to get married . indeed , many might prefer the outright homophobia than that apparent hypocrisy of the catholic church . oh look , another strawman . what does it matter to my lgbt family or friends if the church doesn t consider them eligible for marriage ? they can get married outside of the church . my friend or family member doesn t have to be a christian to be my friend or family . my friend or family member doesn t have to agree with my beliefs to be my friend or family . . what matters to my friends and family is that im not prejudiced against them , nor do i think they have a mental illness that should be cured . you keep talking about 377a as if it s the only issue here , no it s not . you need to stop weaseling around the main point that you are spreading falsehoods about the catholic and the majority of the local protestant groups , because the issue isn t just 377a . it s also about the core teachings of the church and how it affects the daily relationships between lgbt people and church goers . to say that one group teaches love and acceptance and another teaches mental illness is a minor difference , on top of naming only the groups that teaches love and acceptance as anti lgbt out of seven protestant denominations while disregarding the group the teaches mental illness an obvious act of shit stirring . i don t ? for goodness sake for someone that complains over and over about lies and misinformation , you could do well to actually read what you are complaining over . i have clearly explained that while the churches have different approaches it s literally in my first post that the catholic church holds a less critical view , i regard the difference as minor . this is obviously different from the same view . so teaching love and accept lgbt people . don t discriminate , don t judge is a minor difference from homosexuality is a mental illness that should be cured . got it . i understand your stance clearly now . you re a shit stirrer , whether you want to admit it or not . and sorry , catholics are by no means the most supportive of lgbt people . i don t know where this idea is based from , but lgbt find much more support amongst secular support groups than the catholic church . even among religious groups , buddhists are far more accepting of lgbt people . just among christians , it is the free community church not catholic that actually supports lgbt people . come on , are you really that stupid ? is it not obvious enough that i m making the point within the confines of christianity ? let me put it simply for you then since you insist on playing dumb . amongst the christian groups , despite being passively supportive to 377a which is anti lgbt to a minor degree compared to actively organizing anti lgbt campaigns , catholics that teach love and accept lgbt people is the most supportive group compared to other groups that teach homosexuality is a mental illness and groups that actively hold anti lgbt campaigns . . is that better for you ? if you re going to talk about free community church then i m going to ask , why are you shifting the goal post to now include a church that isn t even on the national council of churches ? i literally mention protestants in my first post , which says that both the catholic church and the protestants are the main anti lgbt group . so why not just say christians ? the fact you separate the two groups show that you are not ignorant of the fact they have vastly different teachings regarding lgbt . and since you are not ignorant of that fact , why do you still sterotype them into having the same teaching and stance ? the catholic church is , as a matter of fact , anti lgbt , and you can t run away from that simply because some protestant churches are worse . i never said that they weren t . let me help you establish some facts . 1 the catholic church supports 377a . 2 most protestant groups support 377a . from these two facts , i ll give it to you that they are anti lgbt with regards only to 377a . 3 the catholic church teaches love and acceptance for lgbt people . 4 a certain denomination of the protestants group organizes the wear white campaign , an anti lgbt campaign . 5 a certain denomination of the protestants believe that homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured via conversion therapy . now , you yourself have admitted that there is a difference between the beliefs and teachings of the above mentioned groups . i m leaving out angelicans here for simplicity . however , you are still adamant in saying the difference is only minor , when clearly these teachings significantly affect the day to day relationships between lgbt people and church goers . 6 the person you are defending says that catholics and angelicans are the largest anti lgbt group . 7 the person you are defending clearly knows that he is singling out two specific groups , the catholic church , and the angelican church , which is only one out of at least seven local protestant denominations , and even excluded the non denominational churches by not categorizing the entire group as christians instead . given that the person knows very well there is a distinction between the groups , he still chose to single out group 3 , catholics , and the angelican church , and completely disregard groups 4 and 5 . tell me , what does this behavior look like to you ? why are you defending this ? clearly , you are a shit stirrer .

many trans people thus choose to just do that and find it sufficient to alleviate gender dysphoria and allow us to live as our gender .,gender dysphoria,-1,03-07-2023 10:55,Reddit,"this approach is actually very impractical in practice given how the required surgeries are extremely expensive about 30k for trans women , 100k for trans men and cannot be covered by insurance , the vast majority of trans people in singapore about 90 , based on a survey of 240 respondents have never managed to change our ics , largely for financial reasons . most trans people here are also low income and there s a high unemployment rate , which puts it even further out of reach and creates a vicious cycle where having a mismatched ic makes it difficult to get a job since it outs them as trans , which then makes it difficult to afford surgery to change the ic . there is also a high risk of medical risks and complications , especially for trans men who additionally need multiple surgeries over 1 2 years . a local surgeon allegedly has a 1 in 3 fatality rate for trans men . most can t afford the time off work for the months of recovery , and if they have parents or other family members depending on them , they may not want to take the risk . conversely , hormone therapy is much more affordable and is what changes one s external appearance and sexual characteristics . many trans people thus choose to just do that and find it sufficient to alleviate gender dysphoria and allow us to live as our gender . so this means that there is a large number of trans people who look like and live as one sex but are legally another . it s the case for me . i ve been on testosterone for over 10 years and had top surgery . most people in my life including my colleagues only know me as a guy , but my ic says f . it s an administrative nightmare that inconveniences not just me but others . for example , i ve been denied phone banking services because i sound like a guy on the phone but my account says ms and they refused to believe it was me . another time , a covid testing batch was held up when i asked about the delay the nurses said they worried they got the results messed up since my record said i was a female patient , so i explained i was trans . it also makes travelling overseas dangerous , such as to malaysia and indonesia where being trans is illegal , or to the us where anti trans hatred is at a peak and people have guns . on a day to day basis it means repeatedly outing myself whenever i need to show my ic or interact with any institution that lists me as ms , and it s pretty stressful having to repeatedly tell strangers that i m trans , especially when not all of them react well . i know that many people consider surgery a good criteria because when the policy was first set in the 1970s , it was with trans women in mind , and it was often the only form of medical transition that trans people did . but it s been 50 years and there have been many advances in trans healthcare since then , especially with the rise in use of hrt , such that we really need to relook at those policies .

kay key , a research fellow at the institute of policy studies ips , said that rather , the young want to feel heard and want to know how their feedback was considered during the policymaking process . dr teo , who researches political and social attitudes , said that wanting the leadership to be more consultative can be seen as a development that comes with a society that is slowly maturing politically . generally , young adults today are more highly educated and exposed to other countries with different political experiences , which likely leads to the stronger emphasis on openness and consultation , she added . there is more interest in finding out how decisions are being made and wanting to have a say because it is a way of showing that they are invested in their nation . for mr aamir bana , a 23 year old university student , one area that future leaders could do better in demonstrating their openness to different views is on issues related to migrant workers in singapore . there really isn t a sense that their voices are being heard , mr aamir said . one thing that came out of the whole covid pandemic was that your average singaporean now knows how a dormitory looks like . we know the cramped conditions they live in , we know the hours they work . he said that although he believes the government does listen to feedback from migrant worker rights groups , these conversations are often behind closed doors . but it s not very visible to others that these voices are being heard and taken into consideration , he added . and it extends to people in rental flats , migrant workers and the lgbtq community . respondents in this year s survey were given a list of options and asked to select three expectations they wanted to see the most from the 4g leaders . the results dr felix tan , a political analyst at the nanyang technological university , said the results showed that there is a higher number of educated young adults who are more open to new ideas and different points of views . political analyst eugene tan from the singapore management university smu said that there could also be a popular view among the youth that the government need not prevail all the time on controversial issues . one such topic for mr javier loke , 28 , is same sex marriages . mr loke , an it systems analyst , hopes that the government will be more open and receptive to different views so that people can contribute to the debate without fear of discrimination . in doing so , we can forge a closer and empathetic society , he added . for future leaders to be seen as being more willing to accept different views , mr aamir believes the ruling people s action party pap can begin by appointing more women in the 4g leadership team . sociologist tan ern ser from the national university of singapore said that the 4g leadership could move away from approaches that seem paternalistic . don t come across as judgemental , dismissive and defensive , he said , adding that the government should move towards a social compact centred on partnership instead . however , whether an issue should be widely consulted with the public also depends on the issue at hand . dr chew han ei , a senior research fellow at ips , said for complex , high involvement issues like , say , building an artificial intelligence hub , wide consultation may not be as useful as focused consultations with experts and industry players . mr clarence ching , 28 , said that one way the 4g leaders can show that they are more accepting of different definitions of success would be for the public service commission psc , which doles out the prestigious psc scholarships every year , to do more to reach out to polytechnic students and lower ranking junior colleges . the founder of social mobility non profit access singapore added schools also have the responsibility to encourage more students to apply and give more advice for potential psc applicants . the survey respondents were also asked to select from options listing the most pressing issues that they thought the government should focus on in the next three years . the results the survey showed that a majority 70 per cent believed that the more well off in society should pay higher taxes . however , only 43 per cent of respondents said that they were willing to pay higher taxes to help build a more equitable society . among this group , the majority of them were with the higher household income group s 15 , 000 to s 19 , 999 58 per cent were willing to pay higher taxes and s 20 , 000 and above 63 per cent . associate professor tan from smu said the results suggested that young people are seeking a socio political compact that is grounded in both material and post material concerns . mr ching from access singapore said he was not surprised that inflation and economic growth came out tops despite the common perception that young people are less concerned about bread and butter issues . the economy in singapore will always be one of the biggest concerns singaporeans have especially when the economy isn t at its strongest , he said .

"that said , the government has accommodated by promising 377a will not be enforced though , such a guarantee is not legally enforceable and can change .",377a,0,03-03-2022 20:56,Reddit,"all viewpoints are founded on religious or irreligious values that cannot be explained . even the idea that consenting adults should be free to do whatever they want is based on an unfounded humanistic secular value which favors the pursuit of self interest rather than restraint . by contrast , religious communities do not believe that just because something produces no tangible harm means it is morally permissible . thus , going around calling out people imposing their personal values is ironic because you would also be imposing your values on them . all laws will always upset somebody s personal values . the question is , given that all moral viewpoints are based on unfounded personal values , whose moral viewpoint do we prefer ? unfortunately because we live in a democracy and we all agree on democracy , the government has no choice but to listen to the majority viewpoint . it is easy to use the analogy of racism and the civil rights movement in america but ultimately , these laws changed precisely because there was a change in the majority viewpoint . enacting change takes time , and requires appeals to shared values e . g . religious harmony , the public good , community and family etc rather than ad hominem name calling and shutting down all viewpoints on the basis of religious bias . that said , the government has accommodated by promising 377a will not be enforced though , such a guarantee is not legally enforceable and can change . it is certainly uncomfortable to live in the shadow of a knife that can fall at any moment . i also hardly see the purpose of a law that is not enforced , which merely signals societal disapproval . i support repeal in all honesty , society has plenty of other laws and ways to express their moral viewpoint on the matter .

okay so it kind of just looks like you re unaware of what current standards of care for trans kids are .,trans,1,15-01-2021 16:24,Reddit," first of all , look at my other comment . your claim that studies suggest that a very small percentage of people retransition is blatantly false . the number of children who desist their gender dysphoria before age 29 is alarmingly high . i looked at the article you posted in the other comment i couldn t find your 2008 article , it looks like you posted the 2013 steensma article twice . he used the dsm iv definition that is considered outdated that did not require a child consistently state that they are a different gender than that assigned at birth there s an infographic of the changes in this article https thinkprogress . org transgender children desistance a5caf61fc5c6 wrt . dsm 5 . if you include kids who are gender non conforming but don t have a different gender identity , it s likely going to inflate the any desistance numbers . he also included both children without any developed secondary sex characteristics and adolescents who do have some characteristics and are more certain if they want them . from steensma 2011 https sci hub . do https pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov 21216800 the actual physical changes during puberty usually resulted in hatred of and disgust with their bodies . . . as a result of the increased aversion towards their bodies , the girls became insecure with themselves . . . especially the actual physical changes made both boys and girls feel obstructed in their lives , and resulted in a strong desire for medical treatment e . g . , puberty blocking hormones , cross sex hormones , and surgery . this is me editorializing , but the 2013 steensma study wanted to include both trans kids and kids likely to be mistaken for trans kids . he deliberately included sub threshold gd kids and included two questionnaires that had high sensitivity and specificity in that sample adolescents reports of gd and body image were compared across persisters and desisters , and showed that persisters reported more gd than desisters in the mean total scores of both the giiaa and the ugds . clinically , for the giiaa , scores of less than 3 indicate gd 87 . 2 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 0 of the desisters . for the ugds , scores of more than 40 . 0 indicate gd 97 . 9 of the persisters met the criterion compared to 2 . 2 of the desisters 1 bisexual , natal girl . if he was just looking for trans people , he might as well just have stuck with the ugds . he clarifies in this interview https www . kqed . org futureofyou 441784 the controversial research on desistance in transgender youth that the purpose of the study was to find variables that could act as predictors of persistence , not whether currently existing tools can identify trans kids , so it would make sense that he d want both persisters and desisters in his original sample . we re talking about sexual maturity that only triggers on the onset of puberty . we re not , we re talking about gender identity , that the blaunchedcauli correctly said that as far as we know starts being expressed by about age 3 . it is undeniable that puberty causes an immense change in our psychology . to stop a child s psychological development for the sake of a political agenda is child abuse . that s not stopping the development of psychology for the sake of a political agenda . if you think that either testosterone or estrogen are necessary for psychological development then we should be administering that earlier , not later . i ve not seen any negative studies on kids starting puberty at 16 the age of medical consent in the uk and some us states as opposed younger endogenous puberty timings . it s also for the sake of preventing the development of secondary sex characteristics the kids don t want , idk what the political agenda is . 2 . there are medically advised age limits for medications for children with such disorders . . . they re an estimate to do the greatest good . okay so it kind of just looks like you re unaware of what current standards of care for trans kids are . this is based on what i understand to be the current standards of care known as the dutch protocol https www . researchgate . net publication 51768297 treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria in the netherlands . the adolescent should have reached tanner stage 2 to 3 and be older than 12 years of age . starting around tanner stages 2 to 3 , the very rst physical changes are still reversible . some experience with one s physical puberty is required because the authors assume that experiencing one s own puberty is diagnostically useful . it is at the onset of puberty that it becomes clear whether the gender dysphoria will desist or persist puberty blockers pb are only administered after a child has already undergone some pubertal changes , and even then they only delay puberty , where stopping pbs continue endogenous puberty . cross sex hormones are generally only administered at 16 again the medical age of consent in some major countries . we don t have to resort to hypothetical trans kids making a heavy decision , we already have empirical data on whether kids can make this decision in conjunction with a team of doctors and their parents . there are more studies on trans youth than these , but two i m aware of are this dutch study https sci hub . do https www . jsm . jsexmed . org article s1743 6095 18 30057 2 fulltext sec3 . 3 that looked at kids from 1972 2015 and found that only 1 . 9 decided to stop puberty blockers after starting though if i remember correctly they have no figures on anyone who wanted to transition again later and this retrospective study https www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov pmc articles pmc7073269 that found higher suicidal ideation in those who wanted but could not get pb than those that managed to get pb . 3 . . . . why the fuck are we green lighting a condition that is even less well understood especially in the long term and fraught with political motivations ? see , i do not get what political motivations means . my first instinct is to be glib and say the imh assuming the account is accurate was providing care according to current best practices https www . wpath . org media cms documents soc 20v7 standards 20of 20care 20v7 20 202011 20wpath . pdf ? t 1605186324 , why do you and the moe want to make things political by denying someone else their medical autonomy ? but i don t think the girl who posted , the imh or moe was acting apolitically , they re all making claims about who gets to make decisions on whose behalf . i don t think you , me or any redditor here has no political agenda once we state our opinions on who does or should be making decisions in this case and why . if wanting someone to receive medical care is political , so is propping up the status quo that denies that care

"a lot of very different words were all translated as homosexuality , and it s very unlikely they were all referring to the same thing .",homosexuality,0,24-07-2022 22:20,Reddit,"i find the bible fascinating , tbh ! there s a very similar verse in 1 timothy 1 9 10 which again mentions arsenokoitai rendered as sodomites homosexuals . here s the nkjv because it matches the original flow more closely niv combined some phrases and lost the effect . . . knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous person , but for the lawless and insubordinate , for the ungodly and for sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers , for fornicators , for sodomites , for kidnappers , for liars , for perjurers , and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine . . . and now if you look closely , you ll realise that everything except the line on sodomites comes in mostly pairs and reflects the ten commandments in order the ungoldly and for sinners thou shalt not have any other gods before me . thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image the unholy and profane thou shalt not take the name of thy god in vain . remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy . for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers honour thy father and thy mother . thou shalt not kill . for fornicators , for sodomites , for kidnappers ? ? ? the next two commandments on the list are thou shalt not commit adultery and thou shalt not steal . homosexuality doesn t fit in there , unless we re talking about gay bi men who married women and cheated on them , and says nothing about gay men who aren t married to women and at first it seems curious that kidnapping is the form of stealing condemned . but what if the arsenokoitai were referring not to gay people but to sexual traffickers as the corinthians verse suggests ? kidnapping boys and selling them into sexual slavery under powerful married men was unfortunately a practice back then . it also meets the criteria of both stealing and adultery . to further bolster that interpretation , there s the sibylline oracles an ancient greek text that warns the arsenokoitai from the north will abduct our children . and everything falls together . the two verses finally end neatly with for liars , for perjurers thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour . i don t have specific sources , unfortunately ! a lot of this was my own research cobbling together multiple sources , including very dry texts about ancient greek words . but this video https matthewvines . com transcript by matthew vines comes with a transcript gives a good overview and is an accessible starting point . for delving into the actual text , blueletterbible . org https www . blueletterbible . org is really helpful it shows you the original translations for the whole bible and you can look up the individual words used . a lot of very different words were all translated as homosexuality , and it s very unlikely they were all referring to the same thing .

the majority who support 377a have no idea how discriminatory this law is .,377a,-1,28-09-2018 18:34,Reddit," it s pretty interesting to note that a decent chunk of the appeal 377a lot showcase the same level of bigotry the pro 377a lot has , it s just thrown at the opposite direction . just like in that reddit thread . the majority who support 377a have no idea how discriminatory this law is . for some reason some also have assumed there is no law on the books currently that protects the young and those that do not consent and genuinely think that 377a does all this , and its removal beings mayhem . so its already an uphill task for the lgbt lotto educate the ignorant . then comes this clown who makes a police report on some religious nutjob s opinion . so instead of furthering the cause , he undermines it .

"if all that you see is straight people and relationships , won t you think that liking someone of the same sex is strange ?",same sex,-1,04-02-2022 17:25,Reddit,"it cannot be influenced . i tried to pray the gay trans away and it did not work . i think that the misconception comes about from people realising they re gay only later in life , sometimes much later in life . all our lives , we only see straight people around us and straight people on tv or in movies . it got a little better with the internet , but you still have to seek it out . if all that you see is straight people and relationships , won t you think that liking someone of the same sex is strange ? wouldn t you try to hide it if you realised you were gay ? this concept is called compulsory heterosexuality , formulated by a scholar named adrienne rich . anyway , it means that maybe people you think turned gay just needed time to come to terms with liking people of the same gender . not everyone manages to accept themselves and come out when they re a teenager .

"for religious people especially , being idealistic will only strengthen their resolve to block dismantling 377a .",377a,0,15-07-2020 17:03,Reddit," don t just work on one , work on both . work on one at a time . if you insist that both are tied , there are plenty of people in singapore who would reject the whole package . we probably have a better chance of obtaining most all of the rights of marriage via legislating in civil union rather than marriage equality . be pragmatic . for religious people especially , being idealistic will only strengthen their resolve to block dismantling 377a . one victory at a time .
